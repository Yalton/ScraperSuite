Message: Retard edition>Can anyone project/shift/have an out of body experience?Yes.>Is it not just a vivid lucid dream?No. A full successful astral projection/shift/oobe feels just as, and often even more real than the waking reality you're experiencing right now. The difference between this and even extremely vivid lucid dreams is absolutely huge.>Does it have to be difficult and take me months/years to attain this ability?No, it does not, the only barrier is your mind - both conscious and subconscious. If you think it's going to be difficult, it will. Many people can be successful within their first few tries.>How come? And how is even this connected to astral travel?There exists an infinite amount of realities with infinite "you's" into which you can focus your conscious awareness. Astral projection and other OOBEs are, in essence, the same thing - projecting your consciousness into the Astral Plane etc.>Do I have to come back?Not from shifting.Yes from projecting, but also somewhat up for debate.>Does this have anything to do with the teenager trend spreading on TikTok and in other places?Yes and no. Kids latching onto an idea they may not even understand, pay them no attention.>What is astral projection:https://pastebin.com/HaEvpQBqHOW TO PROJECT:https://pastebin.com/7eDaEmWk>What is reality shifting:https://pastebin.com/k5mAzDvHHOW TO SHIFT:https://pastebin.com/7gUNfDRuGATEWAY HEMISINC TAPES FLAC (VERY GOOD FOR EVERYTHING):http://mgnet.me/eqx0dKaJohn Kreiter AP and Shifting books:https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=CFED89C8F69F4A68AF3DAF85F210F414https://libgen.rs/book/index.php?md5=CE44DD06395DDF32E4083EDF0D248717Robert Monroe - Journeys out of The Body:http://libgen.li/ads.php?md5=374d40df6a379ca6334ec6783621414fMichael Raduga's 3-part seminar on attaining "The Phase":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQjAIlFZWWc[Embed]search part 2 and 3 on YTLast thread:>>34294793
