Subject: /ng/ - Nobody General
Post ID: 34435361
Message: Welcome to the Nobody GeneralThe Nobody is a figure alive today who has extraordinary spiritual powers, including the ability to influence reality with his conscious and unconscious mind, and intuitively receive guidance from the forces of Heaven.He works to elevate people to their true potential, opposing those who seek power over others. He is the coalition between man and holy spirit. Which means the collective appreciation of a neo-Enochian bicameral consciousness that is rushing into widespread experience.He isn't a messiah; he's just like you, but he has found the kingdom of God within himself through sheer dedication, just like you will. Remember that it's you who creates your own reality; with your hands, thoughts, feelings, words. No one can decide your fate except for you and God.>What is the general picture?It’s important we start replying more to the good posters and ignoring the hateful ones, or educating them if possible. So call upon their heads the forces of Heaven for peace, clarity, and wisdom. If this place is to be more than a squandered opportunity, an overgrown garden, it requires voices such as yours, but many more. This is a place for spiritual discussions and help, not drama, attention seeking, or social content; there are other boards for that.Focus on increasing your service to all and be more loving to yourself and everyone in order to raise your vibrational and consciousness level, and learn to forgive yourself and others. This will change the vibration of the planet and raise our shared consciousness, making us a better humankind one person at a time.None of us are perfect, it is by learning to admit and accept this fact one is able to learn, and grow in Truth. Heaven for all is real. Everyone's truest desires are mutual. The only motive is love.If this is your first time here, just remember, it’s going to be okay, you may take shelter and find rest.

Message: >>34435841ConfucianismThe main idea of Confucianism is the importance of having a good moral character, which can then affect the world around that person through the idea of “cosmic harmony.” If the emperor has moral perfection, his rule will be peaceful and benevolent. Natural disasters and conflict are the result of straying from the ancient teachings. This moral character is achieved through the virtue of ren, or “humanity,” which leads to more virtuous behaviours, such as respect, altruism, and humility. Confucius believed in the importance of education in order to create this virtuous character. He thought that people are essentially good yet may have strayed from the appropriate forms of conduct. Rituals in Confucianism were designed to bring about this respectful attitude and create a sense of community within a group.

Message: >>34436394Ariel, you know what this world is... I don't need to explain it to you, for you know as I do, truly and innately. You've seen all the contradictions in the system, I was watching as you picked them apart! Contradictions upon contradictions, somehow all coming to together and functioning. That's because we create reality and logic is hoisted unto reality, not the other way around. Those scientists don't "know", but we "humor" them nonetheless, and then they pat themselves on the back. There are worlds where logic is seemingly nonsensical were you to compare it to this world's logic - while in fact it's very much the case that THAT world's logic functions LEAGUES above this world's logic in terms of overall optimization and capability.The Truth is spoken by God, and thus does the all father project his voice unto Materia becoming Ætheria - all around us as the perception of light itself. He is "the great attractor" and the force of the universe, he is the Pareto Distribution when manifesting in sapient sight, and he is Truth when spoken with love from The Son of His Light. But the son is a child, for he is called the son for a reason - he needs fostering and care, attention and recognition so that the cognition of human mind is thus enlightened via ignition of Truth's Might. And Truth always wins, even when it seems like it loses. Because Truth is timeless - Deception is not.:3

Message: >>34436593Precisely. Intelligence, Cognition, Intuition, Logic, Reason - aspects of consciousness. Consciousness itself becomes less "attracted to itself", and thus does thinking become more so a chore than the actual chore itself.

Kinda like saying to your mom, "okay, promise me first you're not gonna get mad?". It's a tricky trick to get around. xD

Message: Anons, I'm going to tell you my story.I'm in chans since 2008 when there was already cancer (/b/) but never in my life had I seen so much degeneracy. Okay, you're going to tell me that /b/ was a bunch of degenerates and you'll be right, the only difference is that those degenerates were of pure stock and did not follow a specific fashion. Today there is too much degeneracy, too many deviants and the difference is that they have their share of credibility caused by the mass media, the agenda is stronger than ever.Today it clicked when I saw that the bald son of a bitch Larreta took the 2nd of April from the ex-combatants to give it to the trannies, that's when I said: enough.I am putting together a plan, which will take a little time, but it will be achieved. We need to get organized.There is a manifesto, organized channels and people from all countries will come in if they help me to spam it in all the places there are.The idea is that we all put it together.It is time to choose sides.discord gg DuRmfKJq
