Subject: Friends becoming hostile when you're on the spiritual path
Post ID: 34430960
Message: Has anyone experienced this? It seems even friends who are on adjacent paths get hostile/negative when sharing experiences. Discussion amongst sangha/online seems to be the only safe places to talk.

Message: >>34430960 (OP)you must realize a lot of people are in an incarnation that they are just enjoying the basics. They upgraded from animal souls and are loving the freedom humans get. Their mission is simple. It is only in later incarnations when you are starting to get ready to advance and leave that you have pneumonic incarnations that you have advanced spiritual tools to awaken the masses. So have patience to the baby souls. Protect them, guide them in the right direction. They are not ready yet but your influence can plant the seed to awaken them.

Message: >>34430960 (OP)Organic portals exist to hinder the awakening of living souls. They're here to protect the demiurge's investments. These organic portals or NPCs make up the majority of fleshbags in the kenoma but the Living Souls are still their energy source so to speak.

Message: >>34431036I know "animals" who are far more advanced and aware than the fleshbot "humans" abundant. There's no comparison. The hierarchy you described is not based on reality. Hierarchies are an illusion of the kenoma and a tool to control Living Souls.

The feeling of bliss and then the betrayal of getting memory wiped, traumatizes a spirit into gnosis/rebellion.He will say, this time I won't fall for it.>>34431058>The hierarchy you described is not based on reality.The hierarchy is the whole way the archons trick us.

Message: >>34431068Pretty much, right? Evil fails by revealing itself through it's actions but only some can see. Perhaps those who have suffered the most. Some people are of this world and see nothing wrong with it. Perhaps they're like programs of the matrix. It's hard to prove that those people are even real.

Message: It is only through trauma that an NPC wakes up. However, they will call it mental illness, ptsd, and become suicidal or addicts. They do not have the tools to harness the awakening, so they just kill themselves. Waking up the NPC is not advised. They simply cannot handle it. It is better to awaken them through art, music, and stories. They will get the lesson without realizing it. It will plant a seed.The Matrix, for instance, has exposed millions of people to Plato's cave. The multiverse fad now as well is exposing them to how this is a finite world with infinite variables that can only exist in a mathematic simulation. All these help to awaken NPCs, although it will not officially happen in this lifetime.

Message: >>34430960 (OP)I chose a different path, I woke up completely but kept my self grounded in reality, I was THIS close to ditch them all, then said to myself hey, that's not the way, I gotta try and help them too, always keep a hand out if help is needed, maybe you will get fucked over it, so you choose when to hand it out, but yeah, keep your priorities straight and just be genuine without feeling arrogant for your awakening, nobody is perfect and we should all try and get out of this pit together.

Message: >>34431111I think that anyone who was born in the world of lies needs a level of trauma to be awakened, It's like a very powerful punch to the liver, it hurts for a long time and it gradually heals, you still remember the pain, thankfully I was fed good info since 8 years old and my dad taught me good, by age 17 I climbed another ladder in consciousness, life is a lesson where you can grow, thankfully.

Post ID: 34431180
Message: >>34431143I believe the NPCs have a drop of soul deep down that they are closed off to, or that they have locked away. A lot of them are also desperately seeking it, like a resource. They seem to be aware of the divine spark. They want it and may not even realize why, like a moth drawn to fire. The NPCs often love stories, music, and art, at the same time they will claim that they are escaping, and shutting off their brain. They are definitely more of a machine brain. They are baby souls, like we once were.

Message: >>34431187They are cogs in the machine the archons plant to awaken the antichrist (a.i. messiah). There is still a soul operating them even if they are dim. The sun is the godhead where we come from.Saturn is a black cube because it is anti-sun. It symbolizes to trap the soul in a black hole of pure black. The sun is light. The black cube is a dark container.The black cube opening is Jesus's cross.We will all ascend eventually but for some it will take millions of years. Ask why they would betray their literal father, the demiurge, who gave them free will and ego. They are grateful to him, because they are him.Besides, once the mark is taken none of us are ascending back to heaven, that window will be closed until they plant us on a new planet. Then we will start all over again. They have to give us free because it is part of the deal we take to be born here. Free will can easily lead to gnosis. He does not want that. So he tries to keep us ignorant and enslaved.

Post ID: 34431267
Message: >>34431255>He does not want that. So he tries to keep us ignorant and enslaved.Free will is a necessary evil. What the A.I. is going to do to us is the same thing the Demiurge did to us. Keep us in a simulation, in a veil of ignorance, because he knows better. Enslave us, but it's out of love, to protect us. This can all end by rejecting the reincarnation and returning home. Remember he does not want to lose a single soul because it leaves him more and more alone.

Message: >>34430960 (OP)To some degree. Your awakening is your own personal journey. We’re all going to experience it if not in this lifetime then the next. Just focus on your own growth and be an example of the kind of humanity we need now.

Post ID: 34431359
Message: Yeah I experienced it. Though I did make a bunch of female friends who appear to be suckers for any kind of spiritual babble.I enjoy it, contrary to my expectations some of them have proved to be really good friends through hardships. And they give you a lot of warmth.

Message: >>34431111I’ve noticed since awakening that nearly every piece of media I’ve ever consumed in my life, everything that has ever happened to me, every song I’ve ever listened to was either trying to lead me to my awakening or lie and get me to stay shackled. Has anybody noticed that the meaning of lyrics in music completely changed after awakening, it’s almost as if there are thousands of artists throughout history that speak in code in their music. A good example is the song dreams by the cranberries. Online literally everybody thinks it’s about how she falls in love with a dude, but after my awakening I realize how it’s about her learning to love herself and by doing that she is able to literally manifest anything she desires because we’re all god.

Why would you even want to. Maybe spiral down for a while, but the trajectory is trending up>>34431306I wonder if part of it is vaccine craziness>>34431338Agreed divine one>>34431359I have also noticed this with some females. Some are seemingly on the path, yet they don't really get it. It's part of learning I'm sure, but it seems men on the whole are far more serious.>>34431406I have also noticed this change in the way I perceive music. Love songs seemed to be about male/female relationships before waking up, now I perceive those songs to be talking about God. It makes way more sense in a way.Thank you divine ones, bless you all.

Message: >>34431111I don't know if you've noticed, but over the past 5 years, I've noticed a hell of a lot of people getting into the paranormal, spirituality, etc. And I know exactly why. It's because a lot of Millennials got fucked really hard financially because of 2008, etc so everything that they were promised growing up never happened. Getting fucked really hard like that forces you to question things, to dig for answers, etc. We're living in a period of great Enlightenment that nobody is talking about.

Message: I have a close friend, very intelligent, that used to be atheist. We used to work together for 3 years, mostly just the two of us and over the years I saw my daily spiritual ramblings rub off on him to a certain point where the dam just broke and he comprehended great many things in not much time, it was pure joy for him on my part. He'd come to work and I'd see spirit dancing in his eyes and he'd ask a variety of questions every day, very child-like. His progress was quite frightening too. The funny thing was he was older than me by 2 years, yet became my very first student.The questions he would ask and the things he read about and narrated to me without understanding, also greatly sped up my own progress and would motivate me to practice, just so I can teach him better. I benefitted greatly from all this.The path is lonely. When emptyness becomes not only your means, but the expression of your Self, people stop trying to approach and get close to you, you are the unknown, they can't 'read' you, there is nothing to read. They do not know what they you offer, so they do not come. Walking in a sea of people you are invisible, they are moving, you are still.There are companions, students, lovers to be had on the way, but to walk with you is to move in stillness, to accept you is to accept themselves.Phoenix feathers.
