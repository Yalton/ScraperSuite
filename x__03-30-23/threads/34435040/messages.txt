Message: We have lost our connection with nature and became unnatural and detrimental to wildlife with pollution, what if the industrial revolution was orchestrated by the devil himself so that we end up destroying the world?

Message: >>34435040 (OP)Emergent technologies are the shit though. That's what makes this era such a golden age. Late 20th/Early 21st century Earth is dope. Vinyl records. Synthesizers. Cable television. VHS. DVD. 90's anime. Retro game consoles. Then the internet and smartphones and liquid crystal displays and the computers and tech we have now to consume the content of the emerging tech of the past. I think the past 50 years or so has been really cool time to be alive. But my point is you don't get to this part of the cycle without industrializing.
