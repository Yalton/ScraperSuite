Subject: Intention and manifestation
Post ID: 34433832
Message: I have been learning about manifestation for a while now and out of the heaps of information on the subject there seems to be one key takeaway: properly setting intentions.Sounds so simple, yet is probably the hardest part of manifesting anything. What makes it hard:1) The intention must be very specific and realistic2) Needs to be something that your soul actually agrees with rather than something you think you want based on external influence3) Intention must be free from desire. You must simply decide you will have something and have no attachment to whether or not you will have that thing.For people that are desperate and overly emotional, the above steps can be difficult to follow. There are other aspects to it, but the above is my summation on the major keys to successful manifestation. Can anyone verify this or add anything that I am missing?
