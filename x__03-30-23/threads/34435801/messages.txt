Message: As Terry A Davis once said you need to go through insanity before you can become a king.Take copious amounts of psychadelics and weed until you hit the jackpot.It;'s rather traumatic when you become psychotic but it reinvigorated me. Do bad stuff until you get a response from God that's what a certain people do anyway.No need to be demoralised you'ree just not trying hard enough. probably listening to HZ frequencies daily like a normie. start a ritual or something. the worst thing that happened to me is nearly getting raped by a demon or a knife placed at my belly in sleep paralysis they're not gonna kill you just keep going

Message: >>34436502I live under a rock when it comes to media. Has been so for years. I look around me and see friends consumed by their vices, myself included to an extent. I'm no defeatist, just a realist. I refuse to give effort to 99% of people and causes because I do not see the benefit that will come out of it.

Message: >>34435801 (OP)Board is full of demented women and schizos. It's very demoralising to see that there so many gullible tards in this world.
