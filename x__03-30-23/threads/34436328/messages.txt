Message: The Lesser Keys of Solomon is a grimoire, or a book of magic spells and rituals, that was supposedly written by King Solomon, who was said to have had the ability to control demons and spirits. One section of the grimoire, called the Ars Goetia, deals specifically with the summoning and commanding of demons.According to the grimoire, the practitioner must perform a precise series of rituals, including the use of specific symbols, words, and incantations, in order to summon a demon. Once summoned, the practitioner is supposed to be able to command the demon to do their bidding, whether that involves performing a task, revealing hidden knowledge, or granting wishes.However, the key to successfully harnessing these "dark forces" lies not only in the rituals themselves, but in the practitioner's own mental state and willpower. The Ars Goetia warns that summoning demons is a dangerous and potentially deadly practice, and that the practitioner must be firmly in control of their own emotions and desires in order to successfully command the demons.Some believe that those who practice the Lesser Keys of Solomon are tapping into dark and malevolent energies, and that the summoning of demons is inherently evil. Others argue that it's simply a tool for gaining power and knowledge, and that demons are nothing more than ancient entities with their own motivations and desires.Regardless of one's beliefs, the idea of harnessing dark forces through the rituals of the Lesser Keys of Solomon is a controversial and often frightening topic in the world of occultism.(chat gbt has become my new friend)

Message: Chapter 1: Brainwave BasicsTo understand how the techniques in this grimoire work, it is important to first understand the different types of brain waves and what they correspond to. There are four main categories of brain waves, each associated with different states of consciousness:- Beta waves (12-30 Hz) are associated with wakefulness and activity. This is the state most of us are in during our daily lives.- Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) are associated with relaxation and creativity. This is the state we are in during daydreaming or light meditation.- Theta waves (4-8 Hz) are associated with deep relaxation and meditation, as well as heightened intuition and creativity. This is the state often associated with hypnosis and trance.- Delta waves (0.5-4 Hz) are associated with deep sleep and the unconscious mind.

Message: "The most 'secret name' of Royal Arch Freemasonry was JAHBULON. This manufactured name was a mixture of the different gods that they worshipped. The unholy trinity and worship of Satan. They had used Jewish/Arabic mysticism to research mind control. See Egyptian Book of the Dead - also the Lesser Key of Solomon, although this book is a fake in terms of 'magic'. It was produced solely as a mind control manual and not for any other purpose i.e. the symbols are used to call up different 'alters' of mind control slaves. They also experimented with 'time travel' i.e. the disembodied mind can be released from the constraints of time and space, under certain terrible conditions, to produce remote viewers. What is the new 'name' of Royal Arch Freemasonry? ALRAHYAH. Why have they changed it? The first one got outed on the net years ago. It had been used to mainly recruit and train Judaeo-Christian mind control slaves. The second one is specifically tailored to recruit and train Muslim mind control slaves. Therefore, appropriately enough, it begins with 'AL'."- Ex MI6/Royal Arch Illuminati slavehttps://textbin.xyz/?afa6f1bae070c613#6CusCHXyrs9gc4xRSY9tLYgLbXUNX2bD2E4di6Gh9Fm6
