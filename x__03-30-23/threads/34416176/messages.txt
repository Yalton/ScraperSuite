Message: >>34435140>I bought some pure, undiluted fennel essential oil for brushing with, but the packaging says it's for external use only and shouldn't even be applied directly to the skin. Did I misunderstand what "fennel oil" means in the PDFNope, that's the one. Start with 1 drop to test your reaction. Usually it's going to be worse when you first use it. After a few days it normally calms down unless you have serious infection.If you do have an overly strong reaction, dilute a few drops in a shot glass of water and dip your brush in that. You can always scale up once the infection is cleared.

Message: I just read the "Cosmic Death Fungus" AND "The Parasite Pill" pdfs. How should I approach detoxing for both fungi and parasites? Should I do one after the other or is there a method that can target both?
