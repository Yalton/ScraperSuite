Message: >>34436591Clearly you've never been to commiefornia... it turned me INTO a slavic neonazi for a time. Swaztika banners, battle axes and giant portaits of uncle Adolf. I just had to mention that the feather head fallacy of fake history inspired all kinds of poop brains to wear sweaters with those symbols on them and tell everyone who asks that the symbols originated from shit skins

Message: I hate and loath the parasite cube worshiper. They have a never ending fetish for mutilation. They don't even build their cool monuments and temples anymore. No desire or decency for an aesthetic for their Babylon. they even fail at stewarding thier heaping mountain of shit. They will never be saved or sated.Remove cube. Remove cube enthusiasts.
