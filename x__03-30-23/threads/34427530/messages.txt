Message: >>34427530 (OP)The eye is your primary tool, i'd recommend to adjust that first.With that intent stare you'll need all the tech you can get. Babycams with the right model numbers that record orbs around babies at night, all that jazz. With that stuff you can keep that stare.Or relax your stare into gentle curiosity and start from there.

Message: I wore glasses since I was about 13 and I've always hated how they felt on my face. I got Lasik about a year or two years ago and I love driving without my glasses. It was nearly $5,000. I look better without glasses and I'm actually bothered by pictures of me in glasses now. So there are some negative side effects. I wasn't scared and it didn't hurt and it was over in like 80 seconds. The worst part about it was I could smell the laser burning my eyes.
