Message: Ask yourself if a app can really contact aliens, then realize how stupid that sounds, then realize if he wasnt a grifter he would give it away for free. I dont believe he is totally full of shit but come-on

Message: >>34432723 (OP)I have the app and honestly it's basically just another meditation app. You can probably throw on some theta binaural beats and have the intention of making contact with the same result, the app suggests you find a remote place to do so. I went to mount shasta and camped with that intention and maybe it was just a coincidence but I got fed up and as soon as I stopped a bat flew inches from my face from right to left, spoopy

Abductions are almost always negative.If I'm not mistaken he also said that aliens from traditional ufology like Nordics, Greys and Reptilians are a hoax, basically shitting on all the experiences made by abductees and the work done by real ufologers.Also watching his documentaries felt like he isn't telling the whole truth and did them for entirely different reasons, to deceive or simply make money.>>34432969Grow up, it's just a thread asking for info. Also for an apk pirate of the app.>>34432984Meditation could contact aliens and an app could help you meditate.>>34433011Greer is a psy ops so it may not be just a coincidence. The app may be magically developed to give you something real but at the same time to hide the truth from you.

Message: >>34432723 (OP)Aliens are astral elementals described in the works of theosophy. CE5 is a bog standard elemental visualization and summoning ritual.All astral entities are inherently parasitic as a result of their deterioration to subtler forms. They achieve longer lives by obtaining a sympathetic vibration with a living being through emotion. "Good" entities are just rich in developed astral cohesion and have a higher pitched energy, so they will live longer and are less aggressive about their paracitism. They are still the best to work with though, because they will try to engender higher vibrational mental states to parasite off of and probably have decent information about maintaining a good astral form in death. Discern spirits by the emotional state they provoke, which will provoke thoughts that will impress into the astral in their desired way.

Message: >>34432723 (OP)If you really want to see UFOs just take a holiday somewhere remote in the Scottish highlands in winter and watch the sky for hours. The amount of freaky shit I've seen over the years I grew up there is amazing. Stuff like 3 "stars" moving in a massive perfect equilateral triangle formation, must have been a solid craft as the gap between the 3 points was blocking out the other stars as it passed overhead.

Message: >>34434117Everything false, theosophy is a meme.>>34434196I can, it's just that the reptilian shape-shifting phenomenon is very complex and I look at it with healthy and based skepticism, as opposed to the normie reddit skepticism found also in mainstream science and academia.

Message: >>34432723 (OP)The protocol is just guided meditation focusing on the idea of universal love and inviting contact. There are pdfs of it floating free on the web.If you want to do it, you don't need the app. This is for people who like the idea of meditation or maybe doing something extraordinary like, contacting ET, but only if the effort on their part amounts to the push a button. If you believe that ET or whatever is real, and that someway, somehow contact is possible. Why wouldn't you make an effort to see what happens?

Message: >>34432723 (OP)At some point during the guided meditation read by Greer himself, he stifles a laugh, so make of that what you like.It has good info in one place about lots of tangentially-related stuff to do with ALIENZ and see-ee-five, and has some other audio stuff in there too, like "crop circle tones" (like ok yea whatever bro), and if you want to meet a group of people to do "contact work" with it has that functionality also.It's ok... I mean... it's ok... I used it once or twice and didn't really throw myself into it.
