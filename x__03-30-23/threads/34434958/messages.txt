It's like in the past 5 or 6 years all soul just left the world. It's like God abandoned us and just left humanity to rot on a dead earth.

Message: >>34436522So why is it darker since 2016? I hope it's not "muh Trump presidency ruined everything" type crap. Honestly people like you are why he's probably going to get show trialed.>the normiesNormies don't usually study or read. Or have talents that take dedication and effort. I've seen my attempts at redpilling and educating them fall flat because of this.

Message: >>34436569Personally i don't think that Trump or any political aspect has to do with what happened in 2016, it is rather a perception of many anons where they agree that the color of the world has gone, time has sped up, people have become more distant, aggressive and with the right than ever, immigration exploded, the normies invaded the internet, an offensive/censorship and punishment of their own thought began, the women left, everything began to lose credibility and to question themselves, wow, i could go on, the list is huge, you know, It is not that we lived in paradise before, but from 2016 onwards all this was very noticeable.With respect to the normies, don't be fooled, many of them study, read and are very functional members of society and even so they were "vaxed".

Message: >>34436659Thanks for the interesting posting anon. I agree with this judgment yet ironically, I seem to be a bit younger than you so it’s more like “this is the only thing I remember,” basically just remember everything being fucked up, and a sense that it will be like that indefinitely.For me, art (including literature and music as forms of art) and religion are a good way to unplug.http://sentimentalcorp.org/systemsdeath_recordings/jew_kids_on_the_cock/rat_utopia_syndrome/audioplayer.html
