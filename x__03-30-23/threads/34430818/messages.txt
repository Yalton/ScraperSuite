Message: >>34430818 (OP)'Cause it signifies that you are about to get fucked up in ways you cannot even likely comprehend. That's why fren, that is the short answer.Long answer? Eh, lots of parties living and not have black eyes. Most are hostile, to humans. Thus, humans gain more awareness and pay attention for this trait to avoid it and the likely outcome of playing fuck around find out with a black eye.I myself have the capacity to have my eyes go black as coal, though it's somewhat rare. As i have great control over myself(IE i don't behead anyone who merely annoys me, ect.), but it has happened and usually means the other guy fucked up bad and is about to find out. Kek.
