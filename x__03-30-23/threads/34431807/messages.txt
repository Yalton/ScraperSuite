Message: >>34431807 (OP)They are real, but not as many exist now as did in Greek's time. Due to events following the fall of Greek's pantheon.As to their worship and demands. Eh, depends on the god. Though, most are pretty reasonable and chill.Do research my dude, parse the bullshit and see which one resonates with ya and give it what you will. Might get something interesting in turn. :)

Message: >>34431807 (OP)1. Military industrial complex existed 6000 BC. and long before.2. Military intelligence had discovered electro-magnetism by the Bronze Age (meteoric iron)3. Each Bronze Age nation feeds this physics into their cultures; Yin/;Yang, Negative/Positive, Night/Day (Dyeus Pater), No/Yes, and from that a belief in free will, responsibility for actions, the policy of deterrence, justice and punishment under Law, capital L.4. Then dark ages happened. Once iron smithing became mass industrial military complex the old order of electro-wizards died off and the knowledge was lost.5. Greek, Hebrew, Persian, Indian, Chinese religions either form or reform in this period. Celts and Nords never wrote anything down until Christian period so we don't know what their wizards knew about iron and copper getting jiggy with it.Taranis, Thor, Tarhunz, Teshub, Theispas, Deus Pater, Jupiter, Jove, YHWH Father is lightning bolt God so the obvious red pill is it refers to electro-magnetism and E/c2=m.
