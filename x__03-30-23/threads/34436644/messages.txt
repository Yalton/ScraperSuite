Message: You know, I've been here since 2020I don't know if what I feel is burnout, and I just need to leave for a whileOr if this place really went to shit and you know, I'm more inclined to believe in the latterTime will tell I guess, but based on the second thoughtSince the month is coming to an end, and April is rearing it's ugly head againWhat do you expect to see during this coming month?What kind of content do you want read or interact with on this board?I really expect to see some changes in themes and such, but who knows. Also, what kind of themes do you want to see less? What kind of content you want gone, or in low frequency? I come and go frequently, but I haven't noticed a lot changes, other that the quality of discussion (if you want to call it that) seems to be going down the drain as times passes byLet's hope for improvements! I least I doBecause it seems I'll be stuck here for a lifetime, and so will a lot of you. Something different, something new... what are your ideas, anon?
