Message: >>34428926>>34429600One of the most fucked up examples of this in psychiatry are the SSRIs used as antidepressants, like Prozac especially. They are known to paradoxically have ties in a small (but substantial) number of patients to INCREASING the risk of depression, of suicide, as well as to trigger mania (manic episodes), “Bipolar I disorder” (I hate using their DSM terminology”), and even homicidal rage. Many school shooters and mass public shooters were on Prozac or other similar SSRIs.There are many cases where if a patient tells a psychiatrist, “This dosage of this medication actually seems to be making me feel worse, more moody, more unbalanced, as well as mentally slower and having numerous bad side effects,” one possible common response is deciding they need to UP THE DOSE OF THOSE SAME meds. “Get you moreaccustomed to it and have more of it in your body to prevent those depressive or manic episodes!” (even if the fucking drug might be making things worse).Yes, more of those same meds — put you on a higher dose of Prozac, for instance, or of carbamazepine used for some with bipolar diagnoses, etc. Then of course there’s the medical gaslighting, “WE’RE the authorities, YOU’RE the patients, you don’t know as well as we do. Also, YOU’RE the mentally ill one; so wanting to get off the medication or finding fault with it can safely be discounted as just more of your paranoia.”There’s a case where this happened to a mother of a family, with herself having a psychotic nervous breakdown shortly after being put on Paxil, trying to commit suicide; then getting off Paxil afterwards. Two years later, a doctor put her on Paxil AGAIN despite this case history of here; the psychiatrist’s response even being to UP THE DOSE of Paxil after it inspired another psychotic episode of hers, attempt to overdose, and got checked into a hospital. Also tried to kill her two kids, and developed a painful disorder known as akathisia from the meds.

But it’s something that really grabs my goat. Also like giving kids and young adults strong stimulants in a pill form (Adderall, Ritalin, Focalin) to “help them focus in school,” who cares if some of this stuff is almost like cocaine or meth but in tiny little pill form? Who cares about your dopamine receptors?There’s bad eggs and there’s good eggs everywhere, but shit like this makes me think, a lot of psychiatrists and doctors are the same as cops — arrogant over-inflated people in positions of authority, who can frequently irresponsibly toy with or have power over other’s health, life, or death, any casualties be damned because, “That’s just protocol.”

Message: >>34436579>>34436592Hospitals and prescription medication are, at least in some cases, paradoxically there to make us more ill, to unconscionably leech money off of us, and get us enslaved life-long to their (sometimes) stupid (mis)diagnoses or prescriptions.Psychiatry is there to, likewise, in at least some cases, make us MORE mentally ill, push dubious, harmful medication onto children, teens, young adults particularly, but also sometimes just adults, then when or if such people rebel against taking it forever once they realize their brain and soul is subtly and slowly being fried by its long term use (as with antipsychotics, ADHD meds like adderall, and these are common reported side effects of SSRIs like Prozac, by SOME but not ALL people who use it: feelings of depersonalization, dissociation, derealization, as well as just emptiness, internal flatness — “Before, I was depressed, but now I just don’t feel anything, neither depressed nor happy; and in a very disturbingly robotic way, junior just a pleasantly calm way.”)As the old joke goes: What’s the difference between God and a doctor?God doesn’t think He’s a doctor.>inb4 take meds schizoFuck you.William Cooper mentions the school-shooter/Prozac-ties in his “Behold A Pale Horse” and ties it something he called “Project Orion” of the CIA, reputedly to find a way to inspire certain people to become extremely violent and commit attacks on public places, to encourage the draconian gun laws and surveillance measures.
