Message: I'm Mexican, not even in American filled pop cultureI remember going to Walmart on texas and getting fruit of the loom undies and boxersAnd would always enjoy that unique logo, as I googled, other people also enjoyed that logoBut suddenly now it never existed?I know this topic is old, but I revisited a video and thought "shit, I really don't know about this one"The reason I mentioned about the bernstein, is because that's an American theory in its languageBut... That logo? I'm sure it had a cornucopiaI've seen people from other countries saying they alsl remembering it

Message: >>34888800Trips dubs seen also. Yeah many Mandela effects come off as stupid, but sometimes things like the cornucopia comes up. Everybody remembers it. Artists referenced it in the 80s. It's been written about in articles from decades ago, it's been mentioned in the news. There's probably some old 90s news report that shows it in it if any ody has the audacity to check. Why would something like this be a thing. Fruit of the loom claims they never used it in their logos but they have a copyright taken out to do so iirc in the 70s. This is insane.

Message: >>34888752 (OP)>Interdimensional Convergence Mechanisms:While the mechanisms facilitating interdimensional convergence remain speculative, we present two plausible theoretical frameworks: quantum entanglement and cosmic rifts. Quantum entanglement, known to bridge particles across vast distances instantaneously, could potentially serve as a conduit for the merging of entire universes. Alternatively, cosmic rifts, hypothetical ruptures in the fabric of spacetime, may facilitate interdimensional overlap and eventual convergence.

Message: >>34888996>Historical Alteration:Upon the merging of separate universes, historical events within each universe undergo intricate interactions. The outcomes of such interactions may lead to profound changes in historical narratives, cultural developments, technological advancements, and even the fundamental laws of physics. The precise mechanics of these alterations remain speculative, but it is plausible that events, figures, or civilizations from one universe could reshape the timeline of another.

Message: >>34888996>>34889027>Observable Effects:If separate universes were to merge and influence each other's history, several observable effects might manifest. Discrepancies in historical records, collective memories, or artifacts could emerge as remnants of pre-convergence timelines. Anomalies might be detected in the fossil record, genetic lineage, or even the cosmological background radiation, providing potential avenues for empirical investigation.

Message: >>34892548>Everyone is probably confusing the logo with some drawing on a history textbook about native americansI suspect most of the confusion comes from people not really having committed the logo of an underwear company to memory, and seeing the version with the cornucopia first in some online thread, it gets imprinted as something they "remember" it. memory is extremely fallible.Also,>>34892654the cornucopia is not a native American bit of symbolism, it comes from the Greco-Roman culture where it was a symbol of bountiful harvest and of plenty. It was adopted by many governments and entities in the New World to symbolize the fertility and wealth of resources they can claim, but it did not originate over here. As a symbol, it is probably at least as wide-spread as sales of a particular brand of underwear.

Holy shit man keep upExactly. Memories are faulty and malleable, and can be manipulated. Show them the version with the cornucopia, and some number will "remember" it that way since they actually had no strong memories of the actual logo.
