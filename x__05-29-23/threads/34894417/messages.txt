Message: >>34894417 (OP)What do you need a "why" for? You're here, explanation be damned. Make your own why if you really need one so bad

Message: >>34894417 (OP)Satan tricked us into the world with the promise of godhood. This is the result.We took the fruit. We were scammed.The only way back is through Jesus Christ.

Message: >>34894477Wrong. There is an explanation. You don't play super mario and say, what is the meaning of this? It is in the program to kill bowser, and save the princess.Just like that, we are in this program to reject Satan and find Jesus Christ.

Message: >>34894477>>34894501It's now about 'my own meaning'. Why is there something instead of nothing at all?If there was no meaning there would be nothing. Unchanging, forever and ever and ever,
