Message: Has anyone actually dove deep into the Kaballah. If so how did it change your perspective of the world and the universe. I kind of suspect that the People that practise these beliefs didnt come up with it themselves and stole it from a more ancient culture. I really want to understand.

Message: From my understanding, kabbalah is the study of constant synchronicity thats always happening for everyone, people just don't connect the dots. It is more like an advanced method for doing something that is just a huge part of the universe and was studied for years before it was created because, as a mystic, you can't escape it.
