Subject: Kinda Stumped on Animal Shapeshifting
Post ID: 34893709
Message: Been trying to find out more about how to do animal shape shifting for a while, been looking for years now. I've even tried psychedelics for some answers too, inconclusive mostly as well.Things I've discovered so far:-You can astrally change form quite easily-You can invoke said animal aspects and form upon your astral body through specific exercises/rituals, with some noticeable mental effects-Attempting to push it upon the physical body leads to very high resistance, mostly from other external sources-Glowies do not like you doing it they sick shit on you, best to banish before hand-Brute forcing it pisses off spirits akin to the thought police but over magic instead leading to paranormal consequences physically sometimes(Air getting heavy, very dark fog outside, lights dimming,etc)-Best I can get is weird crackling or shifting feelings with next to nothing result wise-Psychedelics keep pointing me at this weird white core thing that leads to death or force puts me in another direction forcefully, if answers are shown instead I either immediately forget or not permitted by something to touch such-The body has descriptive sigils for each part, wouldn't fuck with it though-DNA has some sort of visible interfaceIf anyone has any pointers or more knowledge on such that would be great.
