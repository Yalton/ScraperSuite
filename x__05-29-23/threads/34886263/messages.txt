Subject: What the fuck are we? And why (...)
Post ID: 34886263
Message: I am so desperate for the answers bros. I have been trying to find out why the universe exists in the first place. Why did matter evolve into microbes. And then spur the evolutionary path leading to homo sapiens? If evolution is random was it all just pure fucking coincidence that we're even on 4chan right now? Are life and death even real? Are we the universe itself? Did the universe put us here intentionally? Maybe the big bang is actually an example of a computer 'powering on'? If so, are we in a simulation? Or are we actually just in an entropic universe where everything is finite and will inevitably end? Maybe we aren't here for any reason?I don't know anons, I just can't handle it. I need there to be a purpose. I'm also afraid of dying. I have read up on the AI stuff potentially being able to 'save us.' I'm not sure how it would though. I just can't find an answer to any of my questions. Maybe the answers are unknowable? I'm 23 and I just feel like everything I know about existence is wrong. I always have.
