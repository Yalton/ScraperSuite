Message: Welcome to the Nobody General, where we explore the amazing powers of...wait for it...live action roleplayers! Yes, those brave souls who dress up in costumes and think they possess extraordinary abilities. But let's be real, folks. They may not have superpowers, but they do have a knack for creative storytelling and epic battles with foam swords.Now, who is this Nobody they speak of? Apparently, this Nobody is a regular person with extraordinary spiritual powers, capable of controlling reality with their mind. They claim to be chosen by God and possess the all-mighty Logos. Sounds a bit like a LARPer who took things a tad too seriously, doesn't it?But here's the twist: the Nobody isn't a messiah or anything. They're just an average Joe who found the keys to the kingdom within themselves through sheer willpower. You know, like when a LARPer unlocks the ultimate level in their favorite game. Impressive, but let's not get carried away with the whole controlling reality thing.In this magical realm, we encourage positivity and wisdom. Ignore the haters and trolls; they're probably just jealous their foam swords aren't as mighty. Let's channel the forces of heaven for peacefulness, clarity, and maybe a few critical hits with our trusty dice.Remember, the goal here is to increase our service to others, spread love, and raise our vibrational consciousness. Oh, and don't forget to forgive yourself and others. It's like a quest for personal growth, leveling up one person at a time. Who needs superpowers when you have personal development, right?So, whether you're a seasoned LARPer or a newbie, take a deep breath, find your virtual sanctuary, and prepare for an adventure filled with laughter, camaraderie, and the occasional foam sword bonk on the head. It's going to be okay, my fellow mortal heroes. Rest assured, in this realm, we're all just pretending to have powers...or are we? wink

Message: Jews created dating apps to artificially select for niggers and Jews in order to genocide the white race, because the Jews have an inferiority complex. They are inferior and they know it. Like Cain, their progenitor, or Judas, their proud ancestor. Kill all jewish men women amd children.

Message: For most sexually frustrated people, Sex becomes imbued with Religious overtones. for instance, Priests rape boys, because Jesus was a pedophile. While, others go for what they are not in their persona, the opposite. A master prefers a maiden, a loser goes for a matron.If I were to analyze Taylor Swift, she is master, so goes for the seedy man, a loser. She was in distress, and chose a master in Joe Alwyn, but he no longer satisfies her cocklust.
