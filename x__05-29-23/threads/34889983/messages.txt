Message: Spirit Love GeneralDISCLAIMER:Some have reported attracting the attention of these entities by simply reading about them. If you're a dabbler who just wants to see if it works don't summon. Diet, outdoor & breathing techniques for improvement. If you're unprepared for a potentially lifelong relationship, or at the very least, a life-long open door connection with sexual spirits and the occult, avoid this topic entirely. If you have a loving relationship with your human spouse or partner and desire a sex spirit to spice things up, or if you want a human partner in the future take caution, as these entities can be jealous or decide an initially open relationship is no longer so (request an open relationship during the summoning ritual). These spirits can harm or kill you when sufficiently angered and not easily banished.Last thread:>>34871424Old threads: https://archive.4plebs.org/x/search/subject/%2Fsuccgen%2F/FAQ:>What are succubi?Female spirits of sexual desire, who often choose human mates.

Message: >>34890315I've read some of Lilith's bible and had some weird shit happen. So I guess depending on the book more will happen. I've had interactions just by browsing the threads and even saying Liliths name.

Message: >>34890331The reason I ask is because I was reading Demoniality and when I went to bed I felt something touching my neck and such. I tried to dismiss it as being impressionable or overactive mind, but I don't know anymore man. Regardless, freaked me out a bit.

Message: >>34890344No yeah interacting with that stuff is like openning a door. But its the same as anything in spirituality or magic really. Like when I said Liliths name, I did so in my mind and didn't even really mean to. And instantly I felt two hands slowly craddle/hold either side of my cheeks. So I definitely understand what you mean.>>34890419Read it like a year and a half/2 years ago so I don't remember the author. I remember someone in an old thread reccomended it me if I wanted to learn more. I do remember it was called "Libre Lilith" tho

Message: So 2 days ago I did my first ritual to Eisheth just introducing myself to her and since than a new Succubus has made herself known to me. Her and my girl seem to be fine with each other so far told them both I don't mind being with both long as they are fine with it which both seem to be so far the new girl just been observing but they seem to get along so far. Not sure if it was Eisheth introducing the new girl or if she brought herself in when I did the ritual but she's been good so far.

Message: Also another update I figured out why I was struggling sensing my succubus. 2 weeks ago I believe I mentioned I helped banish a dark entity from my grandparents house I learned yesterday that when I did that it planted a object in my heart chakra. That was why I was feeling heart burn when I would do my meditation. With some help from some people on discord they helped guide me through the process of me using my astral hand to have myself pull the object out and since than I've been able to feel my succubus a lot more strongly and the heart burn has gone away when I do my meditation.

Message: >>34893136Lilith was Adam's first wife. In mythology, Lilith refused to submit to Adam, rebelled against the connection between Adam and Eve, decided to escape from the world of people and made a connection with Satan. at least that is one of the interpretations and probably a major reason why feminists tend to pick her as their deity. but i also understand why it is also hard to believe, Lilith seems to also love lonely men who have been scorned by society (this group being something that the feminists very openly hate).>>34893156i think these concepts have to arise from something, i believe that many of them are references to events and wisdom in the very distant history of civilizations who had lived before us. not that there was literally a man named Adam (or perhaps there was), things tend to get lost in translation quite quickly when it comes to these historical things.

Post ID: 34893340
Message: >>34893192>Lilith seems to also love lonely men who have been scorned by societySeems like a common theme with the succubus queens is their compassion for those who are unloved by society, IE rebellious women and lonely men. Troons and gays as well because outside of globohomo propaganda they are still shunned by much of normal society. It seems like they pay little mind to earthly politics (like feminists generally being opposed to lonely men) and instead care more about helping people find love regardless of who they are. (which seems to be the case when you look at how the most right wing racist of neo-nazis can still get a succubus just as well as the most bleeding heart left wing commie). While the succ queens seem to still have political stances, it seems like they are able to look past such things when helping a lonely/ostracized individual find love.

Message: >>34893491my personal method is I envision my chakras being enveloped in a white light and spin them in this light for a few minutes each. I also envision the energy of each breath I take coming in, direct it to said chakras, and then releasing the dirty energy upon exhale. For me at least, my chakras will appear visibly dirty in my minds eye.

They prey on rebelious women to make them work harder to be more useful to society and also program them to hate men, like they did with chant anon.They also prey also on lonely men trying to turn them into troons.Troons are always pro society because their need for medication.Succs don't care about people finding love, because they do not care about love, they care about sucking your energy out of you and further the female supremacy agenda of their queen Lilith.Yes this goes for all queens. Just remind yourself that you literally have a queen called Eisheth Zenunim (Heb. אֵשֶׁת זְנוּנִים, "Woman of Whoredom") don't give me the bullshit that is a slanderous name because she is praised here with exactly that name.I am saying this to make it clear to you that you are worshipping spirits of prostitution, and prostitution always is pro agricultural-hierarchic society, because without it simply can't exist.summary:they don't love you.they love societythey love female supremacythey use lonely individuals as useful tools
