Message: >>34868473>It's basically true. All those religions have flawed gods that are not worthy of worship.I can't speak to any of the others with such veracity but you've completely misrepresented paganism. Paganism is a spiritual belief system that incorporates a great number of potential gods, spirits, and other influences. To reduce it to "God (singular) is an asshole" is a fundamental misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Like I said, try reading about the other religions and perhaps talking in good-faith discussion with the intent to learn. So far you've just come across as ignorant.

Message: "God" cannot be named or called. Doing so is referring to an entity, there's where christians fucks up. They do a bunch of idolizing and think their way of worshiping is going to save them from damnation.

You would have to forcefully cuck yourself your entire life just for the chance that you'll avoid being tortured in hell for all of eternity. You have to lobotomize your most natural function in order to escape from being tortured for all of eternity.Most people, despite having an idea of goodness represented by the Bible will NEVER be able to live up to the Bible's standards. And even if you did believe and were saved, if you keep on sinning, the devil will come and torment you for the rest of your life. Perhaps you were raped in the ass repeatedly by your stepdad in your childhood. Couldn't believe in a God because it didn't seem right in a world that is so cruel. Oopsies. You didn't believe so I guess you're going to hell.. I could have intervened in your life and showed you the truth but I didn't.. Yeah.. Sorry..You might have prayed and prayed for help but you didn't get an answer. Oopsies.. Now you're in hell and its all your fault. Fuck you.

Message: >>34868239 (OP)a) please include Judaism in your meme critic as it is so hecking valid and importantb) also include Islam to properly differentiate between the three major world views of the main three abrahamic religions (if you are not scared of a backlash)b) similar to Abrahamic religions Dharmic religions like Hinduism has three major philosophical world views: Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktisim, plus several esoteric ones parallel to Abrahamic gnostic traditions the biggest of which is Bhuddism. To lump all of them together is disingenuous but I suppose that might be your post's intention.c) Paganism just means Non-Abrahamic religion which includes hundreds of more or less similar religions most of them probably Dharmic in nature (we often don't know anymore) which means the core concept was that of circular time and rebirths (but not all of them). At least differentiate between a few of them.d) Progressivism and Atheism are organic outgrowths of Protestantism which is very black-and-white and extremely linear and literal in it's outlook (which is why it appeals to braindead npcs the most)What I actually want to see is a multi-dimensional map including at least the three major Abrahamic and more than three Dharmic traditions. There is some overlap but also some stark differences.

Like all umbrella terms, it serves as a category for those who want "similar" things.>Why is there such a negative stigma toward that which is typically indigenous european religions?Abrahamic cults fear and hate anything non-Abrahamic as part of their faith. It's how the faith spreads. And then there's the silly Wiccan claptrap ("Hail the Earth mother and Lilith and buy my book!1!1" ) that get lumped in with Pagans which doesn't help. Meanwhile actual indigenous faiths keep on truckin' as always.As a practitioner of older faiths, I actually find the umbrella term "Pagan" useful as it gives people a rally point and a starting point. Someone goes "I want to be Pagan" and you can go, "Cool. Here's one faith. There's more out there." and watch their minds get blown. It's wonderful to help people embrace their roots and learn more about the world as it really was and still can be. And people looking for others can use the term "Pagan" to find others who follow indigenous faiths, even if under another pantheon.

I don't like their churches feels wrong and I feel the bible can be good or bad. Good if what you comprehend makes you a good person. It's bad if it makes you the opposite of what Jesus is. If I were Satan, I should would influence their bible with falsehoods and see if they believe. See how that can work?Take what you need and leave the rest.. isn't that the point of religion? Too much faith in their Bible instead of understanding the true message. Faith can be a friend or foe.

Message: >>34873633>>34868239 (OP)Why no one in these threads ever actually adresses the christian theological position as explained by church fathers and theologians alike? Why it is always bible belt missrepresentations of christianity born from protestants completely separated from any idea of tradition?Hell is a punishment, yes, but deeper than that is the state of a soul that either consciously or not rejected God during life. Because christianity holds God as the origin of everything that is good and properly real, including love, a willing, voluntary act of separating ourselves from God (that's what sin is), will if taken beyond the grave imprison the soul in that perpetual rejection, forever in suffering for being unable to either give or recieve love. It is ultimately an act of the will, not just the result of "living bad".What we call morality is ultimately the description of a life in communion with God. The idea of existing properly, of being happy while out of communion with our Creator is logically impossible in christianity, which means that, again, an act of rejection will be like perpetually dying, perpetually suffering in a mode of existence for which the soul wasn't made.

Message: >>34868239 (OP)It's kind of simple. This world is a means to make white people God's at the expense of everyone else, after white people literally created nonwhites when Eve had sex with Lucifer. The kids get the hospital bill. There wasn't even a single person nice enough to just abort Cain, who was not perfectly and wonderfully made, but a genetic shot in the dark and a hybrid. Of course it doesn't matter when you're the winner. It's not your problem. There was only one way this was ever going to go and no one have a Fuck that trillions are born into an inescapable fate of sin. This world is entrapment for everyone God personally doesn't like, before they were even born. I suppose of Cain was aborted that would actually be a loving merciful act on God's part, which of course would never happen to any non Adamic creature forced into this world. The biggest irony, is that all white people actually have the seed of the serpent themselves due to telegony. The ultimate hypocrisy. Eve's vagina was stained with Lucifer DNA just like all the beasts fucking white girls are doing today. White people just get an official excuse. This is white privelege. You can do whatever you want pretty much and the worst you get is "everlasting shame" while in heaven. Meanwhile, nonadamites have to wait around as a wandering spirit until Yahshua returns, and then we're thrown into Tartarus for 1000 years, probably tortured into working for Lucifer, against our will (will doesn't matter if you're not white), and THEN we finally get to be destroyed eternally. Eternal death versus eternal life. OMG SO POETIC.

Lol>HOW can God create free will that isnt an imposition, but not create developed free will that isnt an imposition?Because will implies choice. If you don't have a choice you don't have will. If you create a being with choices already made, then have haven't actually created a being with free will now have you? Or you can just re-watch the Architect scene from the Matrix, that pretty much sums up the context of will in the context of inhabitation. Heidigger's "Building, Dwelling, Thinking," is a great lecture on the topic and one that the Matrix scene is built upon. Regardless, I have no idea why Philosophers since the beginning of time have struggled to answer these questions and you have a particular bone to pick with Christianity about this.>Again - there will be choices for developed free will just like there are choices for undeveloped free will.But in one scenario, choices have been made for you and the will has been subverted.>Nothing limits thisBecuase it's about will. You don't seem to understand that when other's choose for you, your will has been subverted.>True, but it's fun to upset therm when faced with their illogic.Logic. Lol. You don't even have a concept of what logic is. Your argument is, bad things exist and I don't have everything I want therefore God is bad.

Message: >>34893583Whether we have free will, and what that means, is a different topic. Even assuming free will, the whole "create it undeveloped and test it" is nonsense when dealing with omnipotence.Really, the ONLY reason to do it this way is so you can have some of the created beings fail your tests.And even then it doesnt make sense not to just create failed will at the beginning.Ultimately, the only thing to conclude is that there is a limit to what the Christian God can do.He CANT make a developed free will.He doesnt have that ability, so He MUST create them undeveloped, and hope they choose what He wants - or hope they dont so He can torture them.

Message: >>34893608Yes anon, God made you specifically so he could torture you with having to work for the things you want in life instead of simply dropping them right into your lap whenever you desire them.

Post ID: 34893687
Message: >>34893608Yes and also christians automatically assume that you would choose to be evil with an undeveloped free will like you can't be born with an omnibenevolent nature without any darkness in you.

They claim god is light but also darkness. Then he isn't light just neutral.
