Message: Has anyone ever seen the version of The Big Lebowski with “Trunk Walter” in it. Everything is the same except Walter has a big trunk and says stuff like “Your out of your elephant Donny” and “This is what happens when you feed a stranger in the zoo!”. He was on the DVD i had when i was younger but my Dad gave it to Goodwill a long time ago.

Message: >>34891201 (OP)Yeah I remember this.When I was a kid me mum would always wake me up at 4am by kicking my door open and screaming "It's elephant time once again, Billy!!!" And she would make me watch the whole thing before I was allowed to eat breakfast.I think I still have the VHS tape somewhere in my garage, I'll totally get back to u guise :)
