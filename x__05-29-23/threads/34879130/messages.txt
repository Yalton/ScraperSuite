Message: >>34884859>>34884897Try red light exposure. There's a ton of IR that gets released at the end of the day and around sunset especially. One of the guys I follow has put a lot of work into red light therapy and thinks that sunburn is so bad because people stay out all day and then miss out on this critical period of light that promotes recovery.Haven't had a chance to test it for myself, but I've heard some good anecdotes along these lines.

Message: I have a question regarding NAC use.I'm on the maintenance protocol right now. Second cycle of three weeks on and a break. But I was wondering if someone more familiar with the reasoning behind the maintenance protocol would explain why the NAC dosage went down from the regular protocol.I'm curious because obviously NAC is the rage in a lot of circles these days and a lot of the longevity guys are basically doing mega doses in comparison. One of those silicon valley guys that's putting obscene money into managing his metabolic health is doing 1800mg morning and night. I clipped this picture of his routine from a video he put up on youtube. It's kind of interesting to compare his routine to stuff we talk about, though I'm skeptical on a lot of the assumptions built into his program (which includes veganism).Anyways tl;drWhy the low NAC dosage? and thoughts on upping it during the maintenance side of the protocol.

Message: >>34894529The dose for NAC depends on your weight, and liver metabolism. This dose could be OK for a large person.
