Message: I had a dream yesterday where a woman told me that on Friday, October 13th, a ritual was going to take place near my house and that I had to take care of myself. The first thing I did when I woke up was look at the calendar and there really is going to be a Friday the 13th in October.What's special about that day? How to protect myself?

Message: >>34893174We had our first date Oct 13th 2015 and she liked the idea of keeping it. I actually proposed in 2019 but we've had to push back the actual wedding because pandemic shit and I was broke. I'm less broke and the scare is over, so it's finally time!
