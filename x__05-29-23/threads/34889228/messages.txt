Every single food and drink has trace amounts of heavy metals in it.When you tally up the total intake of heavy metals in typical foods (Hg, Pb, F, As, Cr, Cd, Al, etc) the total intake is in the range of 1-3ppm for most typical foods.There is simply no way around ingesting heavy metals, and it slowly accumulates and leads to disease that manifests in old age.Flouride Concentrations (ppm):tea (3.7), tap water (0.4-1.0), grape juice (2-3), milk (0.5-0.7), white rice (0.4), etc.Heavy metals and fluoride are found in literally every food.It's kinda funny that schizos freak out about 1ppm fluoride in tap water, but there are equally high concentrations in most food and drink.
