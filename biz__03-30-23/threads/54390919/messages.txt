The broad consumer base is mostly apathetic and consumes anyway, but you're not talking to the broad player base, and even the average nigger realizes they're being taken for a ride eventually.

Message: >>54391529This is pretty accurate actually.The only time I can see crypto working for a game is if the game is 100% on chain in terms of value add or loss so cheating is 100% impossible. The game is designed to be fully decentralized so no one entity is responsible to maintain it.It would be very hard to design something like this. The best example I can think of is a game like diplomacy or something like that where staked coins can behave like a standing military or something to that effect. But even then, such a game would probably be INSANELY toxic.The other possible scenario would be something like a decentralized roblox. I am not even sure how to do that one. But people build assets and sell them within a market. Crypto and nfts would work well in that case.Otherwise? You cant do first person shooters... You might be able to do something like runescape but good luck keeping that 100% on chain... You might be able to do a pretty decent rogue like.Nobody has made a good crypto game yet because people who are good at crypto are not good at game design. And people who are good at game design are not good at crypto. So good luck finding a balance on that front.

Post ID: 54391886
Message: >>54391820But yeah you can do interoperability to some extent sure. But the items will have to act differently across games and the stats will need to be extremely simplistic.You can do it, I know how I would if I had funding.You need to build around slow paced turn based experience in most cases. Good crypto games would be extremely strategic with high stakes and in most cases almost random number generators. Exploring a randomly generated dungeon would probably take a long time and you would need to careful plan each move.Any kind of turn based game is a good possibility. Diplomacy is a great game for blockchain because most of the game is actually very simple but humans have to work together to make alliances and such.There are no good game developers who know what they are doing in this space. But I know what I would do if I was able to make something. I am waiting on something like Pulsechain where it has smart contracts and faster cheaper transactions then I want to explore some development ideas.

Message: >>54391871>Any complex online game will always need a developer with full control.Yeah exactly, the games need to be extremely simple.One aspect that is fun about the gambling. Oddly enough its very hard to do random number generators. Gambling is not possible in a crypto game, you actually want to do design everything so that it has a specific outcome.Loot boxes are not a good idea with NFTs oddly enough lol... Everything has to be done in a way where emphases is on predictable strategy and outcomes. Like playing chess. You want you games to be designed around choices you make and planning ahead and the only randomization is other players choices.

Message: >>54391943>Yes, but if you need those different CENTRALIZED game makers and games to accept and use your token game assets... why use crypto?A game built properly on crypto would be nothing more than a bunch of well executed smart contracts designed with specific rules. It would be entirely built to function on chain. There would be no servers, no upkeep costs, no central entity outside of the devs themselves.The only thing the game devs can sell at that point would be to either collect a tax or selling the fancy UI front end.It would not be a game in any traditional sense. It would be literally be just an extension of crypto itself.>>54391968Is this regarding a way to do proper random number generators? As far as I know Chainlink is going to exist on pulsechain.Id like to try, designing stuff so everything has a predictable outcome in terms of strategy but some things can be randomized like the dungeon itself or anything that involves furthering strategic planning.

It isn't anything really that smart which hasn't been done with fiat, but I've rarely seen it implemented online and integrated into the game properly. It's more of an economics concept than a blockchain one, but I've found it to be very cool and having data(price) easily accessible to both the players and devs makes the game easier to balance.

Some people get rare items that can be traded and those items have in game value but not real world value.If you get money just for playing, if everyone gets money and the incentive to play is money its p2e. If the NFT is just a rare sword in game, thats not p2e.

No its debatable if buying up the best stuff allows you to stomp on plebs but if the game is designed properly this is mitigated by disincentivizing such behavior.>>54394179>>54394207Yeah pretty much.Play to earn functional works by making it so you loot is minted by your actions and you can decide to do stuff with it. break it down into ingredients, sell it on the market ect. It creates a really interesting market.Some people might even play the market as their form of fun buying and selling like any other crypto.

Message: >>54394940>Truth is, most of the existing blockchain games aren't living up to expectations and far off from gaining the level of adoption people seek, the projects focus more on token rather than developing a proper playable gameOh god this is such an insane problem. A proper play to earn game should not even have a minting process. It should literally be a playable experience day one and those that play first get cool stuff sooner. Simple as.>>54394949TrueThough one way to determine balance would be to make it so every stat on an item has a monetary value. So if we find out that strength is far more valued than DEX or Endurance per point then we can simply set a max dollar value for each stat on every item in the game.Thus if a special 2 hand axe has 150 USD cap for the strength stat and everyone pours value into strength because it fulfils some high end meta build then the value of strength per point increases via market value thus reducing how much strength the axe provides.The axe will end up with fluctuating values for the strength bonus via the free market then we don't need to manually nerf it. Balance just becomes a free market adjustment. Min maxing becomes an extension of playing the market.>>54394980>>54395030So there are so many ways to hand this its insane. Shame that its completely unexplored right now because the only people actually doing anything are scam artists with no idea how to actually do anything cool.

Proof of intelligence maybe, card games are the benchmark. You have to be semi-intelligent to play and actually think the whole time, which is what gets rewarded. Engagement, the thing companies seek for profits.

Message: >>54395596Maybe you should look up what Alpies are, its part of the #2 crypto on BSC ignoring Venus because nobody uses that at all, Cake being #1. You need one to get 4.5x boosted leverage above the normal 3 people can use for example, and you will need them to play the game at all in its first stages. Breedable, so you can make more with combined traits.

Post ID: 54395831
Message: >>54395704Its interesting but I don't know.I feel like the best system for a play to earn game is to set it up so the players make the most profit while the devs get a small cut. Which might sound stupid but if the most money trading hands is players to players then it increases activity and makes up only getting a small cut of each transaction. Having NFTs to simply play the game feels like it would cut into the bottom line a bit.I want to look into making a good crypto game but I want to wait a couple months to see how things pan out.I dot like having a gateway NFT to reduce bots though so eh.

Message: >>54395831Yea they hired some magic card game champion to help design the mechanics and he changed their direction on a few things in ways that would promote larger adoption rather than personally benefiting me as a holder. The games not out yet, they keep releasing art of the characters which are not the actual alpie NFTs and what they show. I dont know what epic and rare traits will mean in game yet but it has to be something or the game will die before it starts. I minted a double epic trait one for example and never listed it, theres 5000 BSC alpies and 5000 ETH, the BSC ones are all evil and the Eth ones all good/angelic. The cheapest ones are below the minting cost right now at like 0.4 0.5 BNB, which means thats how much it costs to get extra leverage when farming cake. Thats what Alpaca actually does, lets you borrow cake to farm with, or other cryptos. Its decentralized leverage farming on BSC and theyre branching into a play to earn game to boost the price of the Alpaca currency itself when the game comes out. Alpaca is deflationary its also worth mentioning. Their main focus has always been on security which is sort of interesting given hackers and security was one issue someone else mentioned earlier.

This obviously separates the player base into people that have money and don't care about it, and people that will try to grind out to stay on top. Another option is people rolling over and over for a strong card until there's too much of that card in circulation. Now that I'm thinking more about it, it's looks more like a market simulator than anything else.
