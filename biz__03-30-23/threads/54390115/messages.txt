Message: >>54401592>the turbo first poster also posted on reddit and deleted all their posts.WRONG. The reddit poster was me and I wiped the account because you fucking pussies kept whining about the fact that I was bringing up LEGITIMATE points of concern on the sub, and called Eich out on his bullshit in the AMA when he claimed that BAT mirrored the price of ETH. Just complete horse shit. I wiped that reddit account in case it had anything doxxable on it (it didn't) and stopped using it because I know you guys are all crazy ass schizos. I had absolutely nothing to do with any of that monero pedophiles copypaste posts or any of the other bs he pulled.
