Post ID: 54395573
Message: >>54395507yes there will be a new coin PLS (Pulse) and also a new coin for the new dex, PLSX (Pulse X). Beyond that, once the fork occurs for Pulsechain to be created, everyone will have all of their ERC-20 coins copied onto the new chain. That means if you have 1000 HEX for example, your 1000 HEX will be COPIED onto Pulsechain.No one knows what will happen but it is safe to assume that on Pulsechain, Hex's value will grow as well as PLS and PSLX.
