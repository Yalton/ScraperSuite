Message: >>54395044 (OP)Gold mining stocks seems risky, the last time gold ballooned during the stagflation periode in the 80s, Gold mining stocks outperformed gold and silver significantly.This time it's different, the mining companies are heavily financialized and are heavily into hedging against price drops i.e. shorting.This was not the case during the 80s, Gold mining stocks will not do well in a hypothetical gold bullrun.

Message: Gold is unironically the GOAT.If you've ever seen real 24K gold IRL rather than the goyslop 14-18K they sell to Americans you would understand why this shit will be hoarded forever.The only reason the JEWelers sell you diluted gold is because they don't want you to feel the attraction they have to it so that they can hoard more.Gold may actually hold supernatural qualities even though I don't believe in the supernatural, maybe it's some glitch in our lizard brain that makes real raw gold so attractive, even animals and small children will be more fascinated by raw 24K gold than any other shiny metal or even unnatural shiny things like LED lights.

Message: >>54395044 (OP)He keeps saying gold mining stocks are good value even at the current gold price. I looked at a few of the top holdings in GDX and his fund. Most of them have no earnings or have so little earnings that the P/E is insanely high. How are they good value?I can understand how they could appreciate if gold price goes up a lot relative to mining cost, but that's speculation rather than value.
