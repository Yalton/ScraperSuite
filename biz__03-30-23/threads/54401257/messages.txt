Message: Jon hunting is the most dehumanizing thing in the world. 3rd round interviews should be banned. After the 1st round interview the comapny should be forced to pay u the salary for the postion until they make a decision

Message: >>54401281No it's not, most of the jobs I'm applying for are hybrid wfh, problem is every since 2-3 weeks ago when thr SVB shit happened the comapnies stopped responding all of a sudden so now they are kidn of just putting job ls out there but not actually hiring, just wasting peoples time..

Message: >>54401336There are still wfh jobs. I'm an engineer, I would need to have a completly unhinged seething boss that hates engineers to end up in a place we're they make me come in every day when I do most of my shit on a computer, which is why I quit my last job. U people people seeth over WFH. That's why u are so excited about pushing this anti wfh narrative. There's no way u don't seeth. God knows I did in my last job which is why I quit

Message: >>54401358no i like WFH. im just enjoying the seething about people not finding WFH opportunities anymore. like yeah nigga you kept showing us your 180k salary here and 230k moonlighting salary at the same time. while in your bunny slippers. of course your bosses are gonna find that shit

Post ID: 54401405
Message: >>54401380Again, I'm an engineer, all legit engineering jobs are hybrid wfh. All the jobs popping up say WFH. Wfh isn't rhe provlem, I'm trying to say since rhe SVB shit comapnies have stopped actually hiring for the jobs they put out yet are still putting out jobs to give the illusion to the stockholders that nothing is wrong

Message: >>54401284Unless you’re becoming a CFO or some shit you should never bother beyond 2 interviews at most. Then again I’m not a tech sperg.>>54401405That means the jobs don’t exist and you’re just getting rugpulled while the finance/accounting departments unfuck themselves from SVB you clown. That and companies are probably scared shitless that their golden infinite cash cow just died and they realized how much they’re pissing away on people who do fuck all.

Message: >>54401257 (OP)>>quit 95k job last month>>have to start doing door dash in 2 weeksWhy don't you have any savings if you were making 95k?

Post ID: 54401642
Message: >>54401257 (OP)The “great job market” and the “labor shortage” were just memes you retard. Yeah there are 10 million job openings and everywhere is hiring, but they’re only going to pay you $16 an hour for 30 hours a week lmao

Message: >>54401562Wfh is irrelevant to the SVB shit>>54401589I was only there for 6 month, I had a few grand saved up but had a bunch of bills come in. My rent is payed until mid may..

Message: >>54401644So you already made $50k and saved none of it? Wtf anon

Post ID: 54401712
Message: >>54401644If it was irrelevant, you wouldn’t be seething here. There’s a shitton of companies all over the world that just got bogged because of that, and I would imagine the last thing they want to do is add anyone else to their payroll while they’re trying to dig themselves out of an accounting teams worst nightmare. Or at least one of them. Also,>quitting a 95k a year job after only a few months for no actual reason while you had big bills coming in and no savings whatsoever to float a while onI hope for your sake you’re just baiting for (yous) because if not then you’re just screwed in general for ever thinking that would be a good idea.

Message: >>54401712I still know plenty of people who are wfh right now, u are the one seething. This wasn't about wfh, that was just the reason I quit my job. I'm a design engineer so if a comapny needs to create or alter a product they need to hire my kind even in a recession. All engineering jobs are wfh even before covid..

Message: I finally managed to find a new wfh job after losing my previous one five months ago. its been hard. I think I racked up 15 rejections and 30 times I just got ghosted.the one i finally snagged had 6 rounds.there really is something to be said for stable employment boys. hopping jobs is not as fun and easy as it used to be

Message: >>54401257 (OP)If you have no debt like a car loan or mortgage you can frugal maxx NEET vacation and apply for new jobs for a month and a half. Don't spend any money on anything but food, you'll waste your time door dashing when you can go exercise or read something.

Post ID: 54401834
Message: >>54401736seems like a demoralization thread to me.Nobody is retarded enough to flop that much, also 2.5k coinbase fees on a 7k principal makes no fucking sense

Post ID: 54401853
Message: >>54401830That's the thing I feel so lost without a job(love my career) that I stopped working out and reading and relpased on cigs. Before I relpased I was a FORMER weed and cig addict and the only way former addicts survive is by keeping themselves busy all day and when I can't do that I end up releasing and the weed and cigs just turn me into a zombie who can't work out. I keep telling myself I will require when I get a second round interview but I haven't heard back from anyone except rejections

Post ID: 54401877
Message: >>54401834More like 1.5k. Keep in mind I'm so retarded I was pulling out and jumping back in at least twice a day. The worst part if that the first few times I didn't even realize that coinbase charges a giant fee just for swapping ur coins to tezos or usdcoin. It says 0 doller free yet its like a hundred every time

Message: >>54401736Damn anon you really fucked up. I’m honestly surprised you were able to get a $95k job with impulsive thought like that. But in all seriousness there’s nothing wrong with moving back in with your parents. Nobody wants to go homeless.Another side note, if you didn’t quit on bad terms you could always call up your boss and beg them to hire you back. You have nothing to lose
