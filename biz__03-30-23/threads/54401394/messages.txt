Post ID: 54401394
Message: I own a 4090 and would like to start making money with it somehow. What money-making methods are available to people with high-end PCs? Also, how the fuck do you even read the mining websites? They don't make any sense to me at all: https://whattomine.com/gpus/79-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090
