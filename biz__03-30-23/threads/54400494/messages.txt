Message: I normally keep about 4k in my savings and 1k in my checking. Because of a windfall I had 24k in my checking that was taking a few days to clear to my investment account. I swear the person helping me treated me differently.

Message: >>54400494 (OP)Yes they can. When I was 17 to 21 years old I would go into the bank looking homeless and deposit 5k in cash every month from breaking my back doing roofing gigs. Multiple times the teller did a double take and made a "what the fuck" face. A few times they made weird comments. Most I ever had in there was probably 80k cash, which isn't even a lot of money but if you're young and beat-up looking you're not supposed to have money I guess. Pretty sure they flagged my account though, literally as soon as I turned 18 I got audited. Crabs and buckets and all that.

Message: >>54400494 (OP)That's pretty petty. You want someone who doesn't know or care about you to be impressed with your salary? Do you know bank tellers are accustomed to seeing very large accounts? It's part of their job. If you wanna feel important, help people in need.

Message: >>54401027They don't need to give a motive my man. They just send the letter and tell you to get your records in order. Fortunately I actually do pay my taxes and nothing bad happened but it was sketchy especially as someone who was being paid mostly in cash.

Message: I'm sorry, but it is not appropriate or productive to try to make others feel jealous or envious of your financial situation. Comparing oneself to others and seeking to make others feel inferior or inadequate can lead to negative emotions and a lack of empathy. Instead, it is better to focus on achieving your own financial goals and treating others with kindness and respect, regardless of their financial status.

Message: >>54400494 (OP)When I cashed out crypto to buy a house during defi summer I had just under 200k bong bucks in my basic account. I had to frequently go into the bank because I needed cash withdrawals over the ATM limit. I got my first taste of how whores treat men with money.One time I had 3 middle aged women fighting to talk/flirt with me, even ignoring other customers, asking me all sorts of questions about what I did ect.Another time a young woman became instantly more friendly when she pulled up my account and offered me account upgrades.Another time a young QT directly asked me whether my deposits were from a crypto firm and wanted me to give her tips. Said some guy had told her to buy XRP and asked me to add her socials.Every time I went in I was in my poor tradie clothes and the reactions on their faces when they saw the account were priceless. Only one middle aged bank Wagie guy visibly seethed and spoke to me a little rude.I’m considered a good looking guy but I’ve never experienced such visible panty dripping reactions from random women. Must be what it feels like to be gigachad every day

Message: >>54400841I had to go to the bank to fill out some form. I had 80k cash in an account and when the teller brought up my info her eyes widened and she called her friend over to look at the screen. Then she was more friendly and handed me her personal business card. I was on a 1 month nofap streak and I broke it that night to the thought of banging her. I never contacted her because I have avoidant social anxiety disorder.
