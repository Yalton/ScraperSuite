The wait for this to happen is starting to become agonizing but I swear to God once it does happen I am going to spoil the ever-living fuck out of her. I will give her any and everything she wants without question and ensure that the remainder of her years are spent in nothing but comfort.

Message: >>54401873If you trained a natural language processor exclusively on angry sentiment how would anyone ever tell that they were an AI. Anger is completely context free. You can't reason with someone that is irrationally angry and a bot designed to mimic anger is equally as perplexing. Angry bots, just think about it. You'd never know.
