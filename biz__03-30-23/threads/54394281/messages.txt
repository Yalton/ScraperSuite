Message: >>54399365>Unless the idea is to buy a bunch of $0.03 cases now and hodl for 10 years?Well, that was pretty much the play until Perfect World dropped. Once Chinese people got into the game is when things went tits up on the market. Nowadays, you won't see cases dropping to that level anymore. The D&N case is actually writing history as the first case being actively dropped which managed to break the trend of active drop cases tanking in price until they get moved to rare.If you're really interested in investing, I recommend you pro team capsules since those always appreciate at a faster rate than cases. Just buy them a week before the major ends which is when Valve drops the prices by 70-80% and hold them for a couple of months.

How clean the stickers look on the guns and whether the team won the major or not are influential factors on the probability of sitting on a gold mine. The MOUZ Stockholm 21 stickers are the prime example of a clean looking skin. Tyloo stickers from Stockholm also saw an incredible increase in price, probably due to Chinese fans' support.The RMR stickers also saw appreciation once people started leaking how good some of them look on Source 2.
