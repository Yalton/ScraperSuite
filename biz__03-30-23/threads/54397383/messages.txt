Message: >>54397383 (OP)If you want something truly mindblowing check out SadArbPyre on telegram. Dude has telegram accounts connected to GPT that interact with normal users. Says that's part of the value proposition for the token. Is going to rent them out to tokens and companies as a service. Personalities of GPT are infinitely customizable. Right now he has a sad depressed dog addicted to cocaine as one personality, and a happy dog who loves to exercise as another. lol this is wild.

Message: >>54397383 (OP)The gamblefi narrative is in full swing. Combined this with the rise of Arbitrum presents the perfect opportunity for projects that require a high number of transactions to be utilized. Arbigoat is at the forefront of using L2 technology to bring true fun utility to holders via Double Up Stud Poker. Search it up for yourself and you will find a genuine community of gambling degenerates pushing the future of gamblefi
