Message: Harmony One, can it make a comeback next bullrun? Is it over for them? Only 0.02, 18x to ATH. Thoughts?

Message: >>54401951 (OP)Better to buy LINK for an 800%* return guaranteed next bull then find an easy 200%No point risking your funds on low caps for diminutive returns

Message: >>54401951 (OP)absolutely not. Tse is a turbo autist that doesn't know marketing, they spent all their fucking money on Harmony apes which the community blasted them so hard for after the 100m hack that they fumbled like the biggest amateur hour retards in the space, that they don't even use them for profile pics anymore, and they didn't even have a contingency plan for "boy golly, what if we get hacked like so many other projects have been?"Literally they got hacked and shit their pants because there was zero recovery fund, zero plan for that possibility. So now they are actually broke, their latest medium article was talking about how they're scaling back to save on server costs like getting rid of AWS, and also how their original RPC's are good enough for the network now because of the reduced traffic.They are literally over. They blew their chance at becoming big, they are aimless and Tse is focused on some dumb web domain shit. They have no clear goal now, they are broke, and the only remaining people hate them because their plan to recover the funds is to just pretend it didn't happen.
