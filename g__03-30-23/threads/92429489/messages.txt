Message: ive been working on this take home task for a job where i had to make a recursive to do list where you could add infinite subtasks to a task. the issue im not sure how to solve is that at a certain number of sub tasks, the design will just collapse in on itself because there has to be a slight indent at each sub level of the tree so the user can tell that the subtask belongs to a task or that the subtask belongs to another subtask etc. so if they have a hundred tasks the indent will eventually lead to it going to shit. pic related (please ignore the ugly design) is what I mean. even if I make the indent smaller, font smaller, the containers bigger etc it doesnt solve the issue. wat do?
