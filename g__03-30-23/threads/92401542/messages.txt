Message: >>92448354Yeah I have like six and I only use one. I regret buying one, another is unuseable because the nib is fucked due to it being dropped, another got retired since I got the one I actually use and the other two are decorations beacuse one was a gift and the other I use rarely. If I could do it again I'd just have the Preppy which is the one that's fucked, the one I use often, and the one I rarely use. Plus the gift warming up my shelf. I'd also not have bought four things of ink since I still have two more cartridges to go through.

Message: >>92450403If you're looking for a traditional ballpoint they're pretty good. I used to recommend the Zebra F-301 but since they're made in Mexico the quality is not what it used to be. Pilot are still made in Japan for most of their pens.
