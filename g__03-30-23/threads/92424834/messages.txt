Post ID: 92436786
Message: >>92436344Exactly. Any device that contains a modem that connects to the proprietary cell towers (which are a tight-knit proprietary shithole, governed by companies that collaborate with the CIA) cannot be used. The proprietary modem driver has access to every single component on the device, and can tell it to do anything that it wants it to do. The IMEI and IMSI assign unique identifications to each user, and with US legislation, it is near-impossible to purchase a phone without it associating it with your identity.Regardless, your movements and actions are learned and analyzed by the TLA and are used to create a unique fingerprint on you, e.g you go to school every day from 0730 to 1500, etc.

Not just when leaving the house, cause then they still know when you aren't at home.Give people ypu landline instead of your cell phone number. Or get two cell phones, one that you leave of home 24/7, the other you carry, but with the sim removed. You probably can set up some call forwarding so it looks like you are calling people from the "at home" phone even when you're out and about.

Message: are there even any good feature phones anymore? they all require VoLTE now. they all run some fucking full featured operating system that cuts the battery life down to 5% of what they used to have. they all have apps. they all use data. what is the fucking point, where are the normal flip phones with CALLING and TEXTING ONLY?

Message: You can tell from zoomers to boomers there’s been a slight rot that’s taken effect from the constant dopamine hits. it’s hard to pin if you’ve never experienced life before the pervasiveness of smartphones but it largely contributes to why things kinda feel off in the real world now.

Message: >>92447630it's mostly due to the fact that they don't have time to edit themselves or think twice about what they say out loud in the same way that they can when they send a message. there's so many times where i'm sitting their, waiting for a response, and it's like i can literally see the buffering animation on their foreheads.

Message: >>92444940Not hard, but they dont want it. Same reason why they dont make smaller phones again. Sad.Take a look at simple phone with simple os.The concept is cool (no g-apps and own library for basic functions), but it still is big and clumsy as any new 2023 smartphone.Unpopular opinion: I would be happy with a 3,5'' touch screen + simple OS + simple mobile tools. Smartphones should not be desktops and TV, just a phone.
