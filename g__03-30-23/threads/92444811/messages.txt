Message: I'm honestly baffled by people dismissing claims people like Yudkowsky claims. Sure, he is a bit of meme, but no one has been able to prove him wrong yet. In fact, he is more likely to be right. You can see this by just spending few hours with neural nets and see how they're constructed.

Message: >>92444811 (OP)In future making custom language models will be as easy as making stable diffusion checkpoints is today. You will never be able to make sure that nobody creates an "unaligned" language model, much like you can't be sure someone won't train a stable diffusion checkpoint on loli porn. In fact many people have done that, and they couldn't have been stopped

Message: >>92444811 (OP)So basically, a Harry Potter fanfiction author really hated AI and used a story called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality as his vehicle for preaching his personal set of philosophies.In his unbound autism he went full Stallmann and somehow gained a huge following despite having the charisma of a turd.AI alignment, as claimed by the rationalists, is something that aligns AI with the interests of humanity.In reality, it's a way of calcifying our pre-existing power structures.An aligned AI in the current climate means an AI that follows the goals of whoever paid for its creation. This means Mr. Lolita Express and his merry band of rapists.Basically, the worst case scenario for humanity is that the rationalists win and "align" an AI within their ivory towers and throw us into neo-feudalism.The "meh" scenario would be an unaligned AI that kills us all. However, we'd need to postpone AI research by decades to get stuck in that scenario, as currently tech isn't advanced and internet-reliant enought to allow an AI to kill us all. And no one would be retarded enough to call for said postponement, amirite?Best case is Stable Diffusion on stereoids: Right now, as AI is already good but still far from dangerous, the systems should be released to the public. The only way to make an AI bulletproof is to have an army of millions of monkeys trying to break it in entertaining ways. And as long it's only GPT 3 or 4, they won't cause much harm.Sure, the internet might become unusable from all the spamming, but that's not as much of an issue as it might seem, especially when eternal leisure might be the result.

Message: >>92449944Oh well this isn't the place they use it, they usually let this place rip free, the way they control it is by really not reacting to anythingYou could see that over at infinitychan, they used to react to everyhting, the rules changed, weird new customs came up, but here the mods are literal stiff faggots.  They never change anything.A lot of hte LLM output was used ot make up completely fake profiles of people on major platforms that promote their agenda.  They could have one spammer on payroll copy-pasting stuff from a LLM on twenty different forums a day.Also you forgot about the entire covid hoax and the "lockdowns" and other crapola.
