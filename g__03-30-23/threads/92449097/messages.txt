Message: >>92451009>You don't see many logs because most anons are either poorfags or retarded. You need a 24GB VRAM card to use it in realtime and even with one click installers, you need to find the models and put them in the right place, use certain command line arguments, etc, and a lot of people can't be bothered to fuck with that.Wish they'd just make a damn Colab already, I'd love to give it a shot.

Message: >>92451054If they're 4bit 30B without 128g, they're inferior and not worth your time. As far as I know, Kobold/Tavern doesn't support group size yet. That's why I say stick with ooba, using cai-chat mode, which allows you to directly import your Tavern cards.

Message: >>92451089If they're 4bit at any group size they're not worth your time. And there is a 128g on horde.
