Subject: SENATE BILL 686 (PATRIOT ACT v2) discussion
Post ID: 92450676
Message: https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/686/textThis bill is arguably the most egregious federal power grab in American History.If Senate Bill 686 passes, the federal government can make it illegal to access services hosted in any country the US government deems a national security threat. Countries already considered to be a threat include China, Russia, Iran, the DPRK, and others. If you circumvent these blocks or assist others in circumventing these blocks, the government can fine you <=$1,000,000, imprison you for <=20 years, and force you to forfeit any hardware or property used to circumvent said blocks to the US government. The government can also ban any site that seeks to undermine the democratic process or interfere with US elections. A board of appointed (NOT elected) officials will decide which sites to ban, advised by special interest groups and lobbyists. The government can also legally monitor any citizen for defiance of this act without having to tell them. (Three letter agencies are already doing this, but this will set a legal precedent that this kind of targeted surveillance is OK.)The icing on the cake: all of these proceedings are exempt from FOIA requests. You're not allowed to know what your government is doing. GOD BLESS AMERICA!>>92426721hit the bump limit, but the discussion must continue.
