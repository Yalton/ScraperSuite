Message: >>92447524 (OP)Nope, you will always feel hollow without female attention as it is a biological necessity in humans. It is the sole drive that got us where we are today. AI can never replace biological women with their own minds.Now, on the other hand, birth rates are dropping for a multitude of reasons, main reason being women are rejecting modern men because most men are awful.Is it over for the human race? At some point, yes, but not because incels are jerking off to a computer simulation - they've already been doing that.

How many are married with children? How many barely have a career, live paycheck to paycheck, spending all their time and money on idle pursuits instead of planning for a family or future?

Message: >>92447524 (OP)wdym "is it over for the human race"?this is a good thing. you know that you can just pay for a woman to raise a child and this service will be very popular because whores will completely lose their "jobs" so they will be used for other things like being a breeding farm. if women don't comply the demand for artificial wombs will skyrocket, and that would also solve the problem

Message: >>92449792>main reason being women are rejecting modern men because most men are awful.Responding to bait but it's totally not because of decades of society putting women on a pedestal and praising them making them conditioned to expecting a gigachad come in and sweep them off their feet while also putting all of the expectation on initiating and keeping a relationship alive on the man. The world doesn't owe a man a woman, but it does owe a woman a 9+/10 man? Incel rate has gone up but femcel rate stays the same meaning women are out enjoying getting passed around like cigarettes between their ideal males while average guys just stay out of it, be it by choice or not, and that somehow makes them awful?

Message: >>92450712I had to stop reading at gigachad being uses unironically. No, it's not putting women on pedestals (which is what incels do), it's that men continue to treat women badly and they're at the point in history where they have independence enough to say "no more" to terrible men.
