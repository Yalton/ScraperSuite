Message: >>92450980You dumbass, go onto better.php and they literally recommend you to transcode flacs for uploads. It's literally in their help section for finding new music to upload to the tracker.

Message: >>92450980There are people who have uploaded hundreds of transcodes. There is a script that heavily automates it. The metadata and everything else should already be correct.The only thing against it is class requirements. You need unique groups and perfect FLACs for the higher classes. So, it's pointless for them and you should stick to spamming web garbage instead.

Message: >>92451037Anon probably thinks you mean transcoding to FLAC from MP3.
