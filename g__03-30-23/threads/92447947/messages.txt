Message: >>92448081idk what op is doing, the 6700 xt and 3060 ti are both good for budget 1440p. However, the 12 gb of vram may be more beneficial for higher res, so the 6700 xt might be better. Both cards do well at high fps on 1080p through

Message: >>92448072>it's the shitty game companies hiring low skill pajeetsThis is irrelevant, because this is a FACT. It's the reality of the situation. If Nvidia had more respect for the people who buy their shit and given them more VRAM, those buyers could've had better performance even if the PC ports are lousy. This is not a good excuse.

A few threads ago somebody asked about whether it was AMD conspiracy with media/devs to make Nvidia look bad or Nvidia just trying to scam and force earlier updatesIf you dont have enough VRAM just turn some settings down. How much of a difference can it be? Graphics have been really good for many years now, and it has stagnated almost to the point of regressing when looking at game studios attempting even more realism with face scans and what not

Message: >>92448081Accusations of shilling aside it's all a matter of the games you play and your expectations. Can the 6700XT drive a consistent 100+ FPS in all games at 1440p? Hell no. Can it get you to at least 60 with a few setting drops? Absolutely. Personally I run a 1660 Super at 1440p and it does just fine because the most GPU heavy game I play is Elden Ring. If you're in the same boat then a 6700XT is plenty. On the other hand, if you want to max out CP2077 or whatever then you will need something stronger. Putting cards into "resolution categories" is always fuzzy.

Post ID: 92448310
Message: >>92448159It depends on the resolution of the games you're playing at. I'm not sure what the current state of video games look like with VRAM usage and 1080p, 1440p, and 4K resolutions. I'm also unsure what the future will look like. I have heard however that there are games out there like Hogwarts Legacy and the recently released TLOU that will absolutely struggle with 8GB VRAM even at 1080p and especially 1440p. Whether this is true or not, I cannot say for sure.Here is a video and a demonstration of what happens when you don't have enough VRAM.https://youtu.be/q-iIgleuP-U?t=300[Embed]At around 5:00, the video about DOOM Eternal, goes from 1440p to 4K. The difference in framerate is absolutely staggering, it's more than a 100 FPS. At 4K, the 3060 can barely maintain 60 FPS, but the truth is that the 3070 is way faster than that. If the 3070 had something like 12 GB VRAM, the 3070 would be outputting WAY MORE than 60 FPS. This card is gimped by Nvidia. If you play at 1080p, I don't think it's going to be a problem, because you're most likely not going to be capping out all of that VRAM, but that's just my opinion.

I doubt I will play in 4K any time soon. That is the good thing about not getting a gaming PC too early. Easier to appreciate solid fps in 1080p when all you have had before is a tired old gaming laptop

Post ID: 92448418
Message: >>92448225A few reasons. One is that it's a 1080p bench. There could be minor CPU bottlenecking or overhead differences between drivers. Second is that RDNA2 was very strong at 1080p for some reason. Might be drivers or it might be the chiplet architecture on RDNA3. Third is the fact that the 6950XT they used for the chart was one of the highest clocked models available. It's not a huge factor but worth a few percent.

Message: >>92448081>capable of good 1440p gamingThe 6700 XT is sub 60FPS in new titles, and it doesn't have DLSS. FSR2 is generally inferior in image quality and performance, and it's only in about half the games DLSS is in. Not a good choice for 1440p. If you want to go Radeon for 1440p, you should be getting a 6800 XT in my opinion, although with the 4070 rumored to be $600, the 6800 XT is a bad buy at its current price>6700XT > 3060tiDefinitely not the case>>92448119>even if the PC ports are lousyThere is an argument to be made about console hardware equivalency, but console publishers can't afford to release games into the Steam review meatgrinder.

If you need to, you can always return the 3070, provided the pricing and performance of the 4070 pans out

Post ID: 92448430
Message: >>92448352I think so as well since my CPU is performing as expected, despite being heavily undervolted. I also have a FPS lock in place because of g-sync.

If you have DDR3, strongly consider upgrading to a DDR4 (or even DDR5) platform. Obviously depends on the full situation.

So B550-A Pro from MSI or GB B550 Aorus Elite as backup.If you want AM5https://it.pcpartpicker.com/list/NQZvXyFor intel just change CPU to 13600K and Z690/790 board (Z690 will require UEFI update to run)Grab CPU cooler for around 50€ pcpartpicker has shit selection for Italia.You could go to 1080p but those system is perfectly capable of 1440p.Now tell me good recipe for food you like.
