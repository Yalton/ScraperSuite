Message: >>92450955>It's not my fault dood, those companies are clearly conspiring against me that's why I failed to score a job after 500+ applications.He either has some weird as shit written on his resume/Linkedin or there's a reason why he had 3 internships and those companies called beforehand to find out, like who tf has 3 internships and doesn't score a job at one of them lmao.
