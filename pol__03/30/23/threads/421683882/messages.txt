Democracy is just a jewish recreation of the first government they corrupted.>copied a response to another thread that got shoad before I could post but this seems appropriate in the situationI mean, money may not buy happiness. But not having it doesn't get you that either. This assumption comes from jewish corruption. The west has been taught to value wealth since it is the main means of class mobility after the jews threw out older forms of government in favor of reviving the roman replublic. The very same government they originally subverted and overthrew. Honor and ability was taken out of the equation both times in favor of using wealth to project power. nigger cattle see this and equate money with winning, intelligence.

Message: >>421684161All papists are cancer and deserve the rope. Can't even control their own factions. I remember someone boo hooing about Francis being a Jesuit. I laughed at him and said, "I thought the pope was chosen by the will of God. God wants it to be a jesuit then. Why are you against God's will?Catlickers are a fucking joke.
