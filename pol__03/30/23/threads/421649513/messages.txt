Message: Atheism is just a shallow world view, it appeals entirely to midwits and teenagers. Every genius throughout history believed in God including "atheists" like Dawkins. The idea of an unmoved mover, the fine tuned universe, intelligent design are all agreed upon even by self proclaimed atheists. Atheism is a midwit trap, you're free to disagree with Christianity or any other mainstream religion but platonic ideals are universal. Men like Dawkins and Musk proclaim themselves atheists but believe in simulation theory, which doesn't contradict any of the major religions and is simply intelligent design.

The industrial revolution removing darwinian conditions allowed for the weakening of the gene pool and weak mentalities to thrive.I recommend looking into Dr. Edward Dutton for a more unapologetic analysis of the topic when applied to modern society. He is also an atheist like Dawkins, but doesn't make an ideology out of it unlike Dawkins.
