Turkey finally believed USA threats when Italy had minor earthquake just prior to Turkey deciding about Nato. At that point USA demonstrated "see here in Italy is a minor quake, right next to Turkey, we can do it at an accuracy where italians are not harmed but it surely registers on instruments" You want to be next or not? Its your choice.How did they coerced Hungary though? This one remains secret.

You acted like fools with this invasion, noone will forgive it to you. You'll pay us for all this cruelty with excess and regret you did it.

Message: >>421681301>in nato in everything but name before this, literallyThe name means a lot though, particularly WRT article 5. As it stands, Finland has no obligation to take part in joint exercises in mutual defence with NATO, and an attack on Finnish soldiers acting alongside NATO is not considered an attack on NATO, and can't be considered grounds for NATO action.

You shills should at least try to not seem completely retarded with the points you make.>>421684461>But I can accept if as a price for recognition of Crimea and Donbas as Russian.You're problem is you can't see that Ukraine is refusing, and the rest of Europe is arming them so more of you die. You can hope that's the price, but it's more likely the price you pay is with your life. Good luck on the front lines, or later on in the bread lines lol. What's even funny is that now Ukrainians will never accept Russians again. You've burned the bridge with your largest (and wealthiest) former Soviet Republic. Now instead of an estranged friend, you will find a blood thirsty rival.

Message: >>421683404To deter what nigger?Your country exists due to russia winning Sweden which treated fingols as cattle. Then you got reds and whites like russia did and different fractions won in Finland (whites) and russia (reds). Then ussr won winter war (yes yes fingol throw muh body count here) and spared Finland which was forced to sign peace as best option to lose only Karelia. Then Finland sided with Hitler and genocided Russians and after Stalin won he spared you niggers and didn’t even include you in eastern bloc. Your economy from rural swapland peasantry flourished in logistics between ussr and nordics and that was root to high level of living in fingolia. Then ussr dissolved voluntarily and gave all your brother belters freedom with all infra built by ussr for free. Russia the also took all collective debt of those countries on itself. Fingols leaves peacefully with russia getting hammered in st petersburg and going back half dead on bus to Helsinki, but no you slant eyed niggers need to justify your soros-infested indoctrinated niggerdom choice as threat from russia.

You can pretend it's the same, but it's obvious why there's a difference. Even aside from the fact that it's Russians killing Ukrainians, almost everyone chooses the US over Russia lol. It comes with more money. Even all you foreigners who spent YEARS learning American English know it in your heart. Speaking the same language as Americans comes with big benefits. How many people learn Russian these days?
