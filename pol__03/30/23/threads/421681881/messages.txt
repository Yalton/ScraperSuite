Message: >>421685335There is a direct analogy in Clinton paying for the steele dossier with campaign funds, and labeling it as legal expenses. the EXACT same thing that Trump did. It's not even clear that Trump's legal fees payment is for the money that the retarded l lawyer gave the whore. The amounts are different, and Trump maintains that they were unaware of the payment being made until long after it was made, something that the dumb jew lawyer did on his own.
