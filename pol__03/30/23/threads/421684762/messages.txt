Message: A traffic stop led to the discovery of a Glock handgun that had been illegally modified to fire as if it were fully automatic, according to Sheriff Eddie Hawkins.>Saturday night deputies pulled over a Lincoln Town Car that was northbound on Highway 45 with no headlights. The odor of marijuana was coming from the vehicle, and a search revealed an open container of beer, marijuana and an illegally modified .40-caliber Glock.>The gun was equipped with a so-called Glock switch, Hawkins said. The modification, also called a “chip” or “auto sear,” can be installed in Glock handguns. Instead of firing one round per trigger pull, the weapon will continue to fire at a high rate as long as the trigger is pressed.>The modifications are not made by Glock, Hawkins said.>“Glock does not manufacture anything like this,” he said. “But if you order one from China or Russia, it’s made of the same materials the handgun is made from and even has the embossed logo on them. But importing them into the US is a federal offense.”>Hawkins said the ones found on weapons locally are typically 3-D printed in the United States.>“The ones hitting the streets here have been made on a 3-D printer,” he said. “They’re printing them out and selling them on the street for about $300. … I don’t know if it was printed locally or somewhere regionally or what.”>Possessing the modification itself can bring up to a 10 year prison sentence, and is a federal crime, Hawkins said.https://cdispatch.com/news/2023-03-29/traffic-stop-reveals-glock-modified-to-be-fully-automatic/

Indeed it is not just a constitutional right, but a natural right, a law of nature. That which lives shall defend itself. What with is only the knowledge of god. An aggressor can know in what way they hunt their prey but the hunter may never know what hunts it before it is too late. This is the nature of nature, the diverse beautiful and unknowable terror of God's creation.
