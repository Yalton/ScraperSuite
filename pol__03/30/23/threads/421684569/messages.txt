Message: >beat the charges with ease>galvanises him and his voter base>campaigns more aggressively and pulls over more fence sitters as soon as he denounces the tranny mass shooters that America is siding with (imagine siding with school shooters because they’re trannies lmfao america is a joke)

Message: >>421684569 (OP)Apparently they think a grand jury charging him isn't a good indicator of what a jury for his actual trial will do. They're really convinced he will just get away with it.

Message: >>421684569 (OP)There is a belief with some that nothing matters anymore. We know that isn't true. Biden was damaged by Afghanistan pull out. Trump was damaged by Covid. Shit still matters.

Message: >>421684961You seem to think trump being persecuted in a political witch hunt somehow makes him less attractive to the voting public.

Message: >>421685284Yes, I do believe this wildly unpopular person will become even more disliked once he is in prison.

Message: >>421684569 (OP)You rejects still don't get it 7 years later. Attacking him while aggressively defending his opponents makes people warm up to him. Basic psychology that he frequently took advantage of in 2016.

Message: >>421685509Except trump isn't wildly unpopular. Even if you belive the bidens votes in 2020 were legit Trump still received more votes than any other person in american history except biden. More than king nigger even. Protip: people that vote for trump dont care about obvious political persecution by some partisan DA.
