Message: So this morning I woke up with this really weird urge to drink cough syrup, and as I got up my brain started telling me to do things. First it told me to put my dress on (sure, it's cute, ok), and then I went into the bathroom and started pouring some cough syrup to drink while it proudly started cheering "shes about to get goated on the angel sauce". I took a nap shortly after, and now I think I'm goated.
