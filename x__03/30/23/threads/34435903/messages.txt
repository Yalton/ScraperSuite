Subject: /x/ theories of Music
Post ID: 34435903
Message: Music is CLEARLY beyond the norm.It communes with individuals & groups on a deeper level than almost anything else, allowing transcendent experiences regularly & even extending to animals. It is universally profound & has been since the earliest times, there is clearly something more fundamental about it, though I can't figure out what/how.I think it's related to mathematics, but I'm not sure if one stems from the other or if both stem from a deeper truthWhat are the esoteric implications? what're the /x/ theories? it feels ripe for exactly this type of speculation, but I don't think i've ever seen anything on music specifically.

Message: music is also always incorporated into spiritual practices to increase their effectiveness, like a catalyst for deeper subconscious & the individual & collective soul(also bump)

Message: >>34435903 (OP)The universe is musical in nature, it's really quite clear when you realize it. Matter, and by extension everything that we perceive, is made of energy vibrating and oscillating at different frequencies, tempos, and rhythms. God sang the universe into order, literally.https://youtu.be/wE6A3rmuet0[Embed]

Message: >>34436018Ideal thankyou,I know how this is something that clearly exists in the subatomic realm & can be replicated in labs, but are there any examples of this sort of thing at larger scales? You don't exactly find music in nature, it's always made by humans or intelligent lifeforms, and I can't think of an example from spaceWhy has life evolved to love this shit so much?
