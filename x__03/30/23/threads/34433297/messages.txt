Post ID: 34433297
Message: Welcome. The purpose of this general is to show you how to use your own wonderful human imagination to achieve your every desire.The world and all within it is man’s conditioned consciousness objectified. Consciousness is the cause as well as the substance of the entire world. So it is to consciousness that we must turn if we would discover the secret of creation. Knowledge of the law of consciousness and the method of operating this law will enable you to accomplish all you desire in life.The Main Concepts:>Imagination creates Reality>Assumptions harden into fact>Consciousness is the only Reality>Feeling is the Secret>Prayer, Living in the End/In the Wish Fulfilled (remaining Faithful to your Idea)>You are the Operant Power>There is no one to change but Self (Self-concept)>Thinking Fourth-Dimensionally (Time is an Illusion)>Can I manifest ___?Yes! Creation is finished.>Curious?

Message: >>34435431Nope. If I was able to manifest the step, why wouldn’t I be able to manifest the rest of the steps? Things only go awry when you start doubting.

Message: >>34435644If you were able to manifest the step why couldn’t you just manifest the end? You’re gonna need to do the exact same mental changes anyway. Sequential steps and guiding the bridge gives 3D too much power.

Message: Hey y'all, can I get tips on how to quickly and easily manifest my SP? I am good with other things (a bit too good) but have some hickups regarding my SP so I'd like a third perspective and a routine to follow.

Yes I know a lot of names and trips in these threads claim you can change your height and do whatever. You can’t. Only a desperate idiot would believe them.True. If I felt like the things I wanted just required a positive mindset and hard work and nothing else, I wouldn't be on /x/, lol.>>34434442>You are one that thinks you can turn into a 2D girl.By this I meant I want to be a 3D girl who cosplays as anime girls lol, not a literal cartoon, but I assume that doesn't change your stance on any of that.
