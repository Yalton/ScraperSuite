Subject: Chimpanzee Tree Cults
Post ID: 34422355
Message: So Chimpanzee's have been observed performing ritual behavior at 'Tree Shrines' of their own creation, selecting hollow tree stumps and filling them with rocks and sometimes placing animals bones on them, and throwing rocks at said shrine and only the shrines to make acoustic sounds (unique to the shrine because it is filled with rocks) along with group drumming. They've also been observed performing ritual-style dances to storm clouds and bush fires. For a while now we've known that they also make 'dolls' out of sticks and build wooden spears for various uses.Are we seeing the birth, or have just started noticing, some kind of Chimpanoccultism?
