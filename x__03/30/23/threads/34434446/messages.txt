Message: >>34434446 (OP)Your picrel reminded me of Taoist theory, according to which there exist two forms of Chi (=life force) in the body: prenatal and postnatal.Prenatal chi you are born with (obviously), and everything produced after birth is considered postnatal. Theoretically, postnatal chi is an exact copy, but of course, it might be deficient (for instance, if you have a bad diet and don't get all the required nutrients), i.e. become "diluted".Chi is depleted during the sexual act, therefore, too much sex leads to corruption and debasement.

Message: The Rig Veda literally says that Rudra hates swarthy skin, hate’s black skin, loves fair white skin, the gods have yellow hair, the “Aryan color” must be persevered ect. They’re gods are all Indo-European and introduced by the Vedic Yamnaya Aryan Invaders who conquered them, they even still paint their gods white despite their people losing their white skin long ago for disobeying the caste (which the Vedas warn about). Basically them forcing the British (pure Aryans) out, they transgressed against Dharma and it is no wonder why Democratic India is a shithole now.

Message: >>34434446 (OP)Evil on earth ,in a hard sense, has it's origin in the demons realm. They influence, manipulate, and increasingly control the human world. And their human allies torture the society in physical, psychological and magical ways.Humans itself are not really bad. It's demons who make them bad.

Message: >>34434446 (OP)Everyone be confused because they confused animal impulses with evil. It's hard because we all hate stuff like rape and murder, but these things often arise from animal impulses that the higher brain, for a variety of reasons, fails to contain or redirect. This is not, can not be evil, no matter how much we despise it because if it was then dolphins, chimpanzees, meerkats, even fucking ants would be capable of evil. Clearly that's not the case for evil is a self aware behavior, not mere brute impulse.Real evil has more to do with the truth than being a mean person. Evil is a distortion of the truth to fall in line with a preconceived notion or idea. In other words the world is one way, but in your mind you force it to be another. This contrary thinking is at the base of lots of human abilities, like comedy, but it is also what allows for evil. For example, someone aiding in a mass killing might tell themselves their victims are not human. This does not align with evidence, but the believe it none the less. Contrary thinking. As for why contrary thinking so often leads to such dark and depraved acts, this is also easy to explain. Once the idea becomes superior to reality then the idea is in charge for it now dictates reality. The human is no longer in charge and neither is the world (god) and these are the real source of feelings like love and compassion. Ideas can't feel compassion or anything, they are memes driven by a mindless heuristic process, namely evolution. With these little devils in charge of so many peoples realities its a wonder we dont have more genocides.

Message: This is actually pretty accurate. I wouldn't say it's the source of all evil though. More like it's the source of societal corruption. What corrupts the women is the source of evil, and that is interdimensional
