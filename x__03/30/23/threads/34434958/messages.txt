It's like in the past 5 or 6 years all soul just left the world. It's like God abandoned us and just left humanity to rot on a dead earth.

Message: >>34435941Yeah, but if you're doing stuff that is worthwhile and meaningful then you don't have time to notice that stuff. You said:>since 2016Did you sleep through the 2000s when the "War on Terror" took away a huge number of people's rights? Expanded the surveillance state? Created the NSA that we know today? All that is because of false flag attacks, the biggest being the one with the planes on September 11th. That was a HUGE fraud perpetrated on the American people and worldwide. That and many other similar stunts are important to remember. The resulting Iraqi war and Afghan war were also important. We went after a puppet of Arab Socialism because we had to blame somebody. Saddam Hussein was a nobody who was being used to do that. Also most of the Islamic mujahideen in Afghanistan were veterans of the wars we helped start or encouraged. Osama bin Laden was a CIA asset. That stuff gets memory holed because of people like you, who think the start of all that is wrong with the US was in 2016 onward. It's really sad and stupid. I'm glad I got to see 9/11 happen and be old enough to understand that it was total fraud. I got redpilled at 13 because of that. I hate my government like you wouldn't believe.

Message: >>34435741Thanks, but I'm really not. All I am is some guy who's trying to make something of himself and make up for a lot of laziness. I have been slothful and working off that makes me feel so much better.
