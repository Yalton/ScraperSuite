Message: I bought some pure, undiluted fennel essential oil for brushing with, but the packaging says it's for external use only and shouldn't even be applied directly to the skin. Did I misunderstand what "fennel oil" means in the PDF and get the wrong thing? I trust the anons in this thread, I just want to make sure I bought the right product before using it.

It doesn't occur naturally in any quantity.sulforaphane is pretty much identical to nac and i've seen people claim that it might be better and it's really easy to naturally acquire with broccoli sprouts in combination with sulforaphane magnifying methods like freezing them to burst the cell walls

Message: >>34435140Undiluted essential oils can cause irritations and burns, that's why it says that. It's a liability issue. You are supposed to dilute essential oils by mixing them with something safe before application. Put toothpaste on your toothbrush, place a drop of fennel eo on the toothpaste, then brush as normal. If you do experience lingering irritation, stop using it.

Did I misunderstand what "fennel oil" means in the PDFNope, that's the one. Start with 1 drop to test your reaction. Usually it's going to be worse when you first use it. After a few days it normally calms down unless you have serious infection.If you do have an overly strong reaction, dilute a few drops in a shot glass of water and dip your brush in that. You can always scale up once the infection is cleared.
