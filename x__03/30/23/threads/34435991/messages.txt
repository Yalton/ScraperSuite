Subject: Can you miss your destiny?
Post ID: 34435991
Message: I feel like I have missed mine. Specifically I was supposed to get with a girl from church that I was too much of a chicken shit to go after. She liked me but at the time I was to insecure to realize. I was too in my own head to make it happen. But looking back now, everything was arranged so perfectly by the divine for it to happen that it's actually kind of crazy how many synchronicities there were. Now I am overloaded with regret and feel like life is not worth living anymore.Did I miss my destiny?

Message: >>34436007I really hope so anon. But I just have this overwhelming feeling of regret which is basically making be unable to function in the last couple of weeks. If I am doing exactly what I am supposed to, why do I feel such inner disharmony?

Message: >>34436115Can you clarify? If I am feeling regret, is that a sign that I have missed mine?
