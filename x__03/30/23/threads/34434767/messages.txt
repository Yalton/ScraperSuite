Do not harass readers if your query is refused/skipped.•Traders should respect that a traded read will be granted, as per an agreement of trade. Free readers have the option of picking their queries.•Bullshit queries will get bullshit answers. Same for vague queries.•Making an AQ (air query) by not addressing a reader, in particular, is possible but doesn't guarantee an answer.•Avoid making the same query repeatedly and/or to different readers in a short period, as this may lead to more confusion.•Provide feedback when applicable and be considerate to the reader. We're a growing community, many readers are starting and need to know what they are doing right or wrong. Let's help each other to improve.Prev thread:>>34428752

Message: >>34434853I asked if she's trying to mess with your career- 4 of wands, ace of disks, the magician, prince of wandsHmm it definately feels as she has some intentions rooted in a real and growing issue that she wants to act out on. Seems as if she will rush it, or do it swiftly.This feels weird though, do you have an actual belief that this person wants to destroy your career? Is she doing actions that make you believe this way?On whether you can stop her:- 2 of swords, ace of disks, 4 of disks, 6 of disksWeird reading again, it describes communication and peace whilst also grounding ones self.

Post ID: 34434976
Message: >>34434853The reading can go two ways1. she is trying to hurt your career and the only way to avoid this is to take some time to ground yourself and ensure you are doing everything right in your jobs.2. she's not trying to hurt your career but might be helping you and the only way to figure this out is by communicating with her and see if she has any problems with how you do things. finding peace and strength throughout all of this.Some of this may be your anxiety, im feeling it while I do this query.

Cards were King of a pentacles, Six of Cups, Hierophant reversed, Ace of Wands and Seven of CupsAI: Someone who is grounded and practical may be focused on achieving success in their career and personal life. They are likely to value stability and security, and may take a careful and considered approach to decision-making. They may also have a sentimental side, valuing family and nostalgia.A person who questions traditional beliefs or institutions may have a non-conformist attitude and be open to exploring new ideas and perspectives. They may also be independent and value personal freedom.In terms of chemistry and interest, a strong passion and interest in you from the other person may be reflected in their desire to spend time with you, share experiences, and deepen the connection between you. They may also be open to exploring new possibilities in the relationship

Message: >>34435197Hello,>46 Page of Cups Rx>Emotional Immaturity, Insecurity, DissapointmentThis could mean either you or the other is insecure. I would fathom a guess that you're a little insecure about that situation. It doesn't really seem like a bad reading necessarily. It's best to know these things and confront them moving forward in any relationship. Be that friendship, work related or lovers.However I wouldn't get your hopes up if they're not ready to take introspective looks at oneself. That leads to resentments. Either way; Insecurity means they have feels for you at some level.

Message: >>34434907Me: It was tricky to summarize everything in one post so I'll just post the highlights. I added two cards into thr mix (Queen of Swords, Six of Wands) to expand further in your chemistry and your opinion of them during the relationship respectively.AI: ...These two cards together (QoW/10C) could suggest that your next girlfriend may be someone who is deeply connected to her emotions, and may approach her passions with enthusiasm and creativity.These two cards together (QoW/PoP) could suggest that your next girlfriend may be someone who is dedicated to achieving her goals, and may have a strong sense of self-reliance and independence.In terms of the relationship between you, there is the potential for a strong emotional and intuitive connection, as well as a mental and intellectual connection based on clear communication and mutual respect. However, there may be a need to balance this mental connection with emotional intimacy, as well as a risk of the Queen of Swords energy coming across as overly critical or emotionally distant at times....Overall, the cards suggest the potential for a loving and stable relationship, with a strong foundation of shared values and a deep emotional connection. However, it may require some effort to balance the intellectual and emotional aspects of the relationship, and to navigate any potential challenges that arise due to differences in communication styles or emotional needs.

Message: >>34434916AI: Based on the cards you drew, it seems that this woman may have some level of admiration and respect for you as a man, represented by the Four of Wands and the Chariot. However, her feelings towards you may be more intellectual or analytical in nature, represented by the King of Swords and the Four of Swords. She may appreciate your intelligence or your ability to communicate effectively, but her emotional connection to you may be less clear. It's possible that she values your presence in her life, but may not feel a strong romantic connection at this time.>(Me) I made a mistake and forgot to specify that Four of Swords was reversed. I inquired in what way did that changed the readingAI: The cards suggest that the woman has a rational and analytical approach towards you, and may not be very emotionally expressive. Her feelings towards you may be mixed or uncertain, and she may need some time to think things through. As for her opinion of you, the cards suggest that she sees you as someone who is successful, ambitious, and has a strong sense of direction in life.

The presence of the King of Pentacles suggests a focus on practical matters, such as finances or work, rather than emotional or spiritual connection. Your feelings during the meeting may be positive and content (Nine of Cups), but there may also be some underlying anxiety or worry (Nine of Swords) related to the lack of excitement or direction.

Including the attack unprompted was slight overkill, and saying "I win" gives the impression you could be an Andrew Tate fan kind of guy. When people come on strong right away it's a bit of a red flag, especially with men.The good news is that first messages don't matter as much as your profile and looks, as well as how much she actually gives a shit about pokemon.

Message: >>34435742I broke this reading into parts.Love:>ace of wands, fool r, hierophantIs there someone who has your eye right now? It seems they may not be returning your affections. But someday you will find somone.Career:>five of swords, nine of wands, ten of pentaclesIt looks like your career went through some drama and you are still trying to equalize, but again the future promises a bright future.Everything Everywhere:>six of cups r, three of swords, four of swords r, two of swords, six of swords r, four of wands rIt appears that you are stuck in the past, thinking of what appears to be better days. The cards also suggest that you rest yourself after whatever heartbreak you are experiencing. They are urging you to make the choice and move on. Yes, the final card is the four of wands reversed...but I am reminded of a dream I had when things were really tough for me:I was in a garden, and I was looking at a fancy orchid kept under glass. A person appeared next to me and explained that for the orchid to even bloom, it had to have particular things happen that would harm other flowers, but made this orchid very valuable.Things will get better Abuelita!
