Message: >>34405420did christ write the bible? did christ found the church? he lived, did he not? why didn't he start the church while he lived? why didn't he begin to write down his teachings into a book so that there would be no confusion?how do you know your books are infallible?you literally need to scroll down a tiny bit after googling "vatican gold" to find an article saying "the vatican bank profited from nazi collaborators"satan the accuser, the great deceiver, uses the human mind against itselflabels make things easy to accept or condemn, and what is out of sight is out of mindthey attack one message, but accept another, whatever fits the narrative in their headthey do not seek truth, they seek to reaffirm to themselves they are right

Message: I would say 99.9% of atheists i know are those who resisted usually christian indoctrination and, knowing nothing else, chose not to believe.God does not contradict science, science is the study of God's creation.God is no bearded man with a lightning bolt ready to smite you for your "imperfect nature", God made you perfect because God is perfect, and like an artist loves their work, God loves you unconditionally and forgives your sins.Suffering, as buddhism teaches, is not to be avoided but accepted as a part of learning, as part of the human experience, for we could not know joy without sufferingSelf-inflicted suffering that is, as the wicked ones that oppress, rape, and murder must be brought to justiceGod indeed created evil, for just like joy and suffering, hot and cold, how can good exist without evil? how can the concept of goodness even exist if there is nothing else?Hell and heaven as christianity teach are not real, but part of the con to keep people obedient to the father of liesYou are immortal, matter and energy cannot be created or destroyed, your flesh will return to dust and form life anew, and your soul will return to the aether and incarnate into new flesh similarly, and you will be reincarnated as many eastern faiths believeas for your consciousness, the third entity within you that is neither of flesh or soul, that is your most divine gift of all, a piece of God within you, as God is the great consciousnessthe mystery faiths of the ancient world venerated what they saw, and the modern ones venerate what we do not see, but now i am here, and i tell this to you, we are to do as the gnostics believed and make the two into oneyou will not be smote for not believing, but you will be mislead if you do not seek truth, as there is truth in all faiths and misguidance in all faithsThe moment one becomes comfortable in their beliefs and stops chasing the light, they are accepting darknessThink for yourself and seek truth, and you shall find God

Message: >>34405825do you not understand your sin, son of Man? do you think you had the wrong name, the wrong statue? you butcher what lives to honor what does not, you honor the death of your king that didn't need to die while shunning his people that shouldn't have to starve, you rape eden and wait for paradiseI will tell you now, christ was jesus, but jesus was only the body of christthe false shepherds of the church and the many blindly devout refuse to acknowledge it, but do you truly think an eternal God would only manifest His son once, in one specific place, to one special set of people?christ has taken many bodies, he is the true vine, the liberator, the messiah king, he has appeared before every tribe, and if man would only truly listen to his teachings perhaps we would love our neighbors enough to accept what truths they have to share, from buddhist and hindu philosophy to islamic teachings and even the ancient beliefs of the greeks, egyptians, norse, even the aztecsthere is only one God, and those who think because someone is different they must worship the wrong way or the wrong God they are assuming their neighbor is lesser and they are greateridolaters will ignore the miracles that live and breathe before them and spill blood in the name of statues and empty names; Allah, Jah, God, all of these are names we've chosen to assign to the living Father, but in truth just as He exists in an imperishable realm beyond our senses, so does His name that no tongue could ever pronounce, for how does one assign a name or title to the most high? your parents named you, what came before God to assign a name to Him?

Message: my message is not one of hate, bigotry, antisemitism, or any kind of division at alli understand how it could be perceived as such, and i'm sure the purpose of said posts might fly over the head of certain members of our very own community and they themselves may assume i am some "based, redpilled" personthe alt-right itself, much like the incel movement, is the product of a rather crafty psyop, and the radicalizing of young men over the internet with this culture they've constructed is the pipeline to something greaterwhy does the targeting of the extremely wealthy immediately strike you as antisemitic? have you been touched by their propaganda as well? does not the top percentage of the extremely wealthy have an absurd degree of power and control over our very world? how they purchase politicians to do their dirty work, how they seek to cripple the rights of the working class as much as possible? wouldn't you say corporate greed is a threat to our very planet?why do you think they waited to mute our former president until after the election had been settled? does this not make him a martyr in the eyes of his followers? are you familiar with operation paperclip? perhaps that would help give a new perspective to some thingsmany people completely miss some of the most important things christ said in his time here"it would be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God" isn't that right? or the parable of the good samaritan, back in the time it was written the jews and samaritans shared a great deal of racial tension, and yet it's the samaritan that comes to the rescue and not the people of their own culture and tribethe jewish people have been made the scapegoat for far too long, judas was actually one of christ's closest disciples and was purposefully singled out when the bible's word was twisted for evil to shift the blame from the ones responsible

Message: are you saying christ spoke truthfully, saying that we must eat his flesh and blood?he worked miracles, surely he could make the bread and wine into his true flesh? or did he lie, and it was not to be taken literally?perhaps it was merely symbolic, but wouldn't that contradict his own teaching? christ said only through righteous acts will one reach salvation, but a rite of consuming symbolic flesh can supposedly guarantee that you're following him correctly? would it not be easy for corrupt politicians and greedy businessmen to simply go to church, feast on his flesh, and never truly repent? would that guarantee their salvation?if these all contradict, why would christ speak them all? did his tongue divide like a serpent? surely this wasn't to hurt us, was it? was he a thief or a con man? or was he a teacher, testing us before he left the earth to see if we understood his message?

Message: "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan, as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?" He said, "He who showed mercy on him." Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."the important context that perhaps the modern age lacks is what a samaritan was to a jew, and vice versathe jews despised samaritans, and they the jewsdo you not see the irony of a jew in need being passed by a rabbi and a levite, but not a samaritan that he is supposed to hate?a modern day equivalent would be if christ told you that a good orthodox man such as yourself was saved from death by one of the "genetically inferior" children of God you so look down onchrist wanted you to see that if you only gaze upon the surface level of the flesh, you will never see who is truly your neighbor and who is a serpent in your tribe's skinlet go of your ignorant pride, son of Man, and you too will be a neighbor in the world to comego forth, and sin no more; or turn up your nose and go about your self-righteous and prideful ways, God gives you that choice to make, i only pray you make the right one

Message: The bible is a book of mythological symbolism that communicates spiritual truths learned by the men who wrote it along with a guide to living for the people at the time. God is consciousness and the universe, he manifested the material universe to that he could experience creation through a brain that limits information, allowing him to experience it through a linear perspective so that he wasn't experiencing everything timelessly all at once. This is obvious if you know how to read and understand the full picture of the bible from a meta perspective, the kingdom of heaven is within. Christ was an image of the perfect man we should seek to embody as much as possible.

The only point you can raise here is how the majority of people using LoA use it for frivoluous and superficial means, but that's on them and not the practice itself.

The romans eventually converted somewhat to christianity, but it was basically just a reskin of what the established religion(s) of the empire and a lot of the rituals/culture of their religion remained. That's why people eventually protested again roman catholicism. It wears a christian skin but underneath is it pretty much 100% pagan in origin. It borrows largely from a "mother and son" archetype found in many ancient religions eg. Ishtar, Horus, which is why there's so much emphasis placed on Mary as almost a deity in her own right, while she actually a fairly minor character with several other children, brothers of Jesus and they are named and spoken about a few times in the actual bible, so she wasn't a virgin after Jesus's next brother was born, yet still prayed to and hailed as the virgin Mary by catholics due to her actually being a reskinned version of Isis for them.Haven't read the rest of this thread.

Possibly was never saved to begin but I did go to Church and had a laying on of hands even if I didn't completely follow through with that at the time. I did a lot of willful sinning between October and apostasy period anyway like going real hard into drugs and having pron periods and kept falling back into divination.The apostasy didn't end well for me. Kind of just went back to a lot of hedonism and ended up getting fucked by my own vices and had people gunning for me cause of it. I kinda hop that my conversion wasn't necessarily real in October to begin with. Still concerned but I live soberly and have had a successful no fap since coming back so far. I know there's a lot more to sin than just getting drunk and watching porn but I feel as if there's some slow progress in other parts while some sins like sloth I still struggle with greatly. I'm still concerned and filled with FUD regarding my salvation status.

Message: >>34423210No, that is all forgivable. The only reason you wouldn't be taken back is because you believe you shouldn't. You have to keep trying and do better the last time you fell down.

Message: I keep stumbling on my walk with Christ. I do good for a few weeks at a time, sometimes a few days, then I fall back into sinful thinking and action. I still pray daily and that helps, but I have a lot of old habits (mainly lustful stuff, porn and sleeping around) that I fall back into. Is Christs love really that redeeming that even I will still be saved? I think I need to get away from anything that could trigger those things but it’s very hard. I guess I’ll pray on it and trust he shows me the way

Message: >>34423376Correct. The only unforgivable sin in in the Bible is blaspheming the holy spirit:>Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.

Message: >>34423850>>34425236Thanks for the link, very helpful.I do recommend listening to the whole thing but the gist of it is that blaspheming the Holy Spirit is the refusal to accept that you have a need for it in the first place, and the reason it cannot be forgiven is that acceptance of the Holy Spirit IS the salvation Jesus promises.In other words, HE cannot forgive that sin, because it is YOUR choice to accept or refuse it. He can only offer it, but you must accept it in order to be saved.

Message: >>34431192Yes and you can make it more effective by believing in it.> “Have faith in God. For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.” (Mark 11:22-24)

Message: >>34431192yes prayer works and you make it more effective by showing your allegiance to god and doing his will. you are saved if you believe. but you may be cursed in this life or blessed in this life depending on how much you misbehave and how truly soery you feel. fasting and prayer work effectively, for if god hears your prayer, which he does, surely he will do what he will do about it. study the scripture in the bible, and try to do his will.

Message: >>34432050Prayer is communicating with God without that intent it isn't prayer anymore, someone who is good at it can do silent prayers which is effectively trying to use visualization or their inner monologue to talk with Him instead. Focus based meditation is becoming hyper focused and is pretty much any exercise that you use to focus your mind even small things to improve your focus you do not intend to communicate with God but instead improve yourself, mental emptiness meditation is putting yourself in a trance and that just makes you a chutzpah.Anything past this is stuff like breathing emphasis and posture which is additive to these practices.From all my cautious digging I've come to conclude that all the yoga shit is unnecessary and all "putting yourself into a trance" is bad shit to stay away from. Take away from that what you will.

There is no real foundation to anything you say on Jesus as a person nor your worldview because you're nothing but a delusional fairy and manchild with brain damage and religious trauma. You'll go to extreme lengths to discredit and slander Jesus because your very being recoils at the mention of His name.I *understand* the catholic church isn't the most wholesome nor righteous of institutions as I can grasp how an atheist would question the resurrection and crucifixion, but your hypergraphic scrawls that would give Francis E. Dec a run for his money go beyond basic bitch atheist and satanist anti-christian sentiments. You twist both verse, parable and word into the exact opposite of what it meant and call it "divination", Your comprehension of your beloved mental disorders (i.e schizophrenia and psychopathy) are grossly distorted misunderstandings based on superficial meme definitions every terminally online fucker uses.You aren't mystic nor divine, nor do your beliefs even remotely resemble anything of the truth. What you profess to be "the truth" is nothing more than an elaborate cope to cover up the fact that you were raised by a single mother and got touched by a priest in childhood.You are to mysticism, schizophrenia and esoterica what trannies are to biological women.A mockery. A clown.
