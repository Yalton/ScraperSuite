Message: Succubus/Incubus GeneralDISCLAIMER:Some have reported attracting the attention of these entities by simply reading about them. If you're a dabbler who just wants to see if it works don't summon. Diet, outdoor & breathing techniques for improvement. If you're unprepared for a potentially lifelong relationship, or at the very least, a life-long open door connection with sexual spirits and the occult, avoid this topic entirely. If you have a loving relationship with your human spouse or partner and desire a sex spirit to spice things up, or if you want a human partner in the future take caution, as these entities can be jealous or decide an initially open relationship is no longer so (request an open relationship during the summoning ritual). These spirits can harm or kill you when sufficiently angered and not easily banished.Last thread:>>34417555Old threads: https://archive.4plebs.org/x/search/subject/%2Fsuccgen%2F/FAQ:>What are succubi?Female spirits of sexual desire, who often choose human mates.
