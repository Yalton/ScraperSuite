Message: >>34422585i guess the obvious question is, why does technology advance while we have an omnipotent god who also creates all the food we eat? the overall situation seems pretty complicated. i guess it can be summed up pretty nicely by saying nobody has free will, and all of this has been scripted to happen since the start. a better way to say it is that this world would happen with or without anyone here to observe it. there is actually a lot of proof of this, the most obvious being the fact that posts that end in 3 digits in a row are typically more interesting. i've personally witnessed more proof but i wont include it in this post, its not something i can prove to you people without a doubt. i guess it would be weird for our creator to script me to write this entire wall of text that nobody is even going to read. i guess the next obvious question is, why is life literally only torture? why cant i eat and have sex, and why does he make me watch rich chads fuck my crush?
