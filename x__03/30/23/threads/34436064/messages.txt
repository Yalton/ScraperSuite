Message: OK niggas. Im going to -mark my words- stay awake for enough hours to stay awake for -total- 72 hours . 3 days sleep deprivation + Gateway tapes is an absolute must, or an absolutely sure-fire way, to reality shift.I can no longer bear this shitty reality...even if I cant change anything else by shifting, at least MY life will be better.I dont ask for much ;I know what I want and I know how to get it.>60 hours awake left until I shift. these will be either the best or the worst 60 hours of my life
