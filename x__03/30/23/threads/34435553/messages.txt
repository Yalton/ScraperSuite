Message: >>421667286This will sound incredibly schizophrenic, but ill post it.Ive begun to believe that anybody born before 1990 is a fraud, demon, non entity that exists to demoralize us. All of history is unprovable, just read a book, just believe what others tell you, "back in my day", "When I was your age". All bullshit. Our demonic creators made us during this time of strife and suffering on purpose, for some reason, maybe something past life related. But we only exist to suffer. How did we all exist within the same exact time frame, and coalesce to the exact same shit hole website to talk about our suffering? Out of billions of people on this godforsaken planet, we are the ones who see the light? Yet we are unable to do anything about it except unironically Lift heavy object and place back down repeatedly. That is the only truth that we have. Everything else is under the control of someone else.I've talked to my mother of this, she doesn't get it. CLAIMS she is "Christian" yet won't say>Christ is LordWhen asked, so I called her a demonic whore and she began to cry. No refutation no insults towards me, just silence. Call out all demons on your personal lives and the light will only become that much brighter. We will make it out of this. I'll see you in the next dimension my brothers.
