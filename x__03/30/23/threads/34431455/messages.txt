Message: >>34432961If you watch the vid, it looks like it is a tethered balloon with wind coming from left to right. It bobs up and down along an arc with a center to the lower left. At the end, it is being reeled back down, towards the anchor point.The design is pretty much "generic satellite look," combining elements from several iconic satellites .

Message: >>34432961>Your link looks nothing like the image posted shill.I dunno, it looks similar to this one. If it IS a rocket tank, it could come from a rocket from any of several countries using somewhat different designs and materials.But I dont think that's what it is, I think it's a water heater or something stuck in the bushes for the picture.

Message: >>34433004I'm not going to argue against that because it does act like a balloon. It does match the way the wind is hitting the tree's. The problem that I have is that it looks nothing like sputnik, or the hydrazine tank, and it's not the only one that took place over Cali.I've seen a video of a similar object floating over a different part of Cali in 2016 with a military Helicopter circling it while people filmed it on the ground. There was never any news coverage, or disclosure.Not to mention the whole Roswell thing is balloon related, and even this Chinese spy balloon shit was sus af.The object is actually known as the Mosul Orb now because of the sighting over Iraq, and I know that I can't prove it but I saw one flying at night time months ago about a mile, and a half in the sky.It didn't move extremely fast, but it definitely wasn't slow. I'm even convinced it could have been some kind of advanced drone.

The OP whatever looks a bit like the tank posted here:>>34433044but is not identical, so it is not that specific make of tank. But since we can't see all of it because of the tree, it's hard to be sure WHAT it is. I assume at some point they took it down from the tree -- does anybody have a pic of it without tree blocking half of it?That said, I don't think it IS a hydrazine tank, I think it is some sort of water tank or something put in a tree for the picture. Can't prove it, of course. Just what it looks like to me.>I've seen a video of a similar object floating over a different part of Cali in 2016 with a military Helicopter circling it while people filmed it on the ground.I have not seen that- if you can find it please share it. Sounds interesting. I'd expect a balloon flown once in CA (I guess as some sort of advertising thing) to be flown again, so that does not seem strange. The helicopters part would make it worth seeing, to see what is going on.>Not to mention the whole Roswell thing is balloon related, and even this Chinese spy balloon shit was sus af.Balloons exist. They get seen sometimes.>The object is actually known as the Mosul Orb now because of the sighting over Iraq,The Mosul image is interesting, but the fact that they released only a single frame from a short video clip is suspicious to me -- why not release the while clip? Only reason I can think of is that the whole clip gives away what it is, and it is not actually interesting.

If you are up for sharing where, when and such, that would be interesting. I'm curious as to how you established its altitude, too. I'm off to lunch, but will check back later.>It didn't move extremely fast, but it definitely wasn't slow. I'm even convinced it could have been some kind of advanced drone.Possible.
