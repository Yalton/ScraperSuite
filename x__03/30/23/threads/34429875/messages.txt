Message: The scariest aspect of this universe is, without a doubt, how uncertain it is. Literally anything can occur or crumble it the right conditions and circumstances are met. This is why books and movies centered around time travel always fuck with me psychologically. Your very best friend can instantly turn into an adversary plotting to murder you if certain things occur that nudges his thought process in that direction.Nothing is absolute or certain. Everything is conditional and subject to change.Why the fuck are we confined to only one dimension of Time?
