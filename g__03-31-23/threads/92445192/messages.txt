Message: >>92445192 (OP)what should i do if i can't open nvidia control panel? i have Win 10 Pro 22H2, and my GPU is Nvidia GTX 1650. I tried reinstalling the drivers and I also tried checking services to see if Nvidia Display Container was already running, which it was, i tried restarting it but it also didn't do shit.I have the option for the panel on the desktop but it doesn't do anything when I click it.However when i right click on geforce experience in the notification bar, the option for it is no tthere.
