Post ID: 92468069
Message: >>92467961Exactly. The particular brand of socialism that socialists/WEF promotes is the authoritarian socialism that China/USSR promotes. Where people own nothing, where the gov controls all means of information/thought/behavior.There is an alternative to this. Its called "post-scarcity" society. Thats achieved through free market capitalism. Which gets you all the benefits without the negatives.

Some of the tranny artists are crying because the value of the art is now less than a penny. There's virtually an endless supply of art goods being produced at the cost of electricity and competition being fierce, even the cost of electricity is discarded in favor of gaining attention. So now the post scarcity market has evolved into attention market.
