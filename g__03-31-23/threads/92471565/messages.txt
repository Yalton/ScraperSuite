Message: Modern AI can sound natural enough to hold debate people and will stubbornly hold whatever point of view they are given. That doesn't sound so bad until you realise they can flood every public forum on the internet 24/7.There is also the problem of governments using AI to automatically spy on pretty much any network they want.What makes this absolutely devastating though is that they could flood any discussion anywhere on the internet coming up with a solution with endless 24/7 F.U.D. to discourage anyone from even trying.I fully admit i'm to much of a brainlet to come figure this out, but i still think we need to get the ball rolling on this discussion as soon as possible and i don't see it much.>tl;dr dont let bot shills tell you to relax>inb4 what if you're a bot?nigger kikes tongue my anus
