Message: >>92467536 (OP)You know what the funniest thing is that I thought about today? It's about how I see these people here with their shitty 8GB VRAM cards trying so hard to defend their shit purchase, and how the PS5 and the Xbox One Series X can both use up to 12GB VRAM. So, the truth is that their garbage 8GB video cards are literally worse for the most demanding games that require a lot of VRAM than these 2 fucking dumb boxes. These are the same people who make fun of these garbage consoles.When those game developers are porting over their games that were build with the PS5/Xbox Series X in mind, they're not going to give a shit about your measly 8GB VRAM. That's what has been happening lately with TLOU and Hogwarts Legacy, and it will get even worse in the future.Anyone who buys anything less than 16GB VRAM is fucking retarded in their head. That is a fact.

Historically, there's certainly an argument for brute force of hardware to get good performance on PC. REm4ke doesn't have a VRAM problem with optimized settings as per DF (and my own investigations), and TLoU is still up in the air. A punished game like TLoU does not a trend make, but I'm open to the argument that console ports will be unable to scale well to lower VRAM buffers in the future. This doesn't mean that Nvidia has been jewish with VRAM; keeping VRAM bloat in check is good for consumers because ultimately the costs of excessive VRAM get passed on to said consumers.Even so, last gen midrange cards do fine even according to HWUB at 1440p: the VRAM is sufficient for the performance level>>92468727You're a drone who fell for Radeon's marketing. The default has always been Geforce on PC; therefore historically Radeon has offered its gullible customers useless VRAM, when it could have offered cheaper cards with less VRAM.

Also the RTX 40 series GPUs have much higher clockspeeds than RTX 30 GPUs (possibly Samsung's inferior process is to blame, who knows), which is how the new GPUs derive a substantial part of their TFLOPs.Look at the previous gens, like the 960 Ti to the 1070, or the 2080 Ti to the 3070. Those were massive value improvements, partially brought on by node changes, but the same cannot be said about the 3080 to even the 4070. The 40 series is a lost generation in terms of value, much like the 20 series, although the 20 series was more justifiable because of the introduction of RT and DLSS.>>92468965>it's better if people buy amd GPUs with more vram>muh vramNon issue.

Your VRAM bloat argument gets weakened by the fact that the Nvidia released the 3060 with 12 GB while releasing the 3060 TI, 3070, and 3070 TI with 8 GB and the 3080 with 10 GB. They've also released the 1060 with 3 GB and 6 GB of VRAM. This has been a consistent thing with them.

Regardless, the 3090 Ti has about 28B transistors and the 4070 Ti has about 35B transistors according to the TPU GPU database. 2080 Ti and 3070 had around 17 or 18B transistors, and the price got more than halved for similar performance. Clearly consumers aren't seeing the benefits of a new generation in terms of value. Why? Probably because, just like there was a shortage of 10 series cards and this caused the 20 series to be "replacements" (e.g., 1080 Ti and 2080, same price and perf, ignoring RT and DLSS), we're coming off shortage pricing so RTX 40 series is just a replacement series with a tacked on high end.>>92469326>VRAM configurationsThere were known GA104 SKUs with 16GB and GA102 SKUs with 20GB.https://www.tomshardware.com/news/rtx-3070-ti-16gb-appearsNvidia never released them because even the base models couldn't be kept in stock. Personally I'm fine with options like the 1060 versions. The 3GB worked very well through the card's life as playable 1080p card. Either version is too weak for recent demanding games at this point, at least in my opinion.>3060 with 12 GBMakes sense considering the original lineup plans, where like I said there was a planned 16GB 3070. The 3060 12GB is definitely a good card entry level card for Stable Diffusion or Blender

Message: >>92472265It will add latency because you can't break physics but will it impact the performance in meaningful way?The bigger issue is buying one that won't cause you problems with signal integrity at PCI-E 4.0.

Message: Anyone know if the RTX 4060 will have 8 or 12 gigabytes of VRAM, and would it be worth it to get the 12gb RTX 3060 if it only has 8?

Message: >>92472358RTX 4060 will have 8GBRTX 3060 is not worth buying, it's too weakThere are no Nvidia GPUs worth buying at the moment, wait to see the MSRP of the 4070 and get that if it's under $600.

Message: >>92469146Thanks anon, I updated the BIOS. Still, it hasn't fixed the issue. However, the mobo DRAM orange led light is glowing. I have tried switching the RAM sticks, yet still nothing. I have no clue at this point.

Post ID: 92472550
Message: >>92472265It's barely more distance than plugging the GPU into the last slot on a full ATX board, it will be invisible for latency. Like others said though, set your x16 slot to gen3 in bios beforehand unless you know this is a gen4 or 5 riser

Message: >>92467536 (OP)People talk about the 3060 8gb having a nerfed bus size of 128 compared to the 12gb one, but so does the rx 6600 and people say its even better than the 12gb 3060, why?

Message: I'll probably sell my 4090 and upgrade to the 4090ti when that comes out. I just want to always have the most powerful card available, it will eat away at me if I have just a 4090 in my PC when I know there are 4090tis out there in the wild.

I intended it to just be the "HDD" drive where the music, memes, pictures, and not porn will reside on.I know 1tb might seem comparatively small to some but this 1tb HDD I have currently still hasn't been filled after 6+ years of use so I don't really feel the need to get more.

Message: >>92472670>usuallythis is keyword anon. with used cards there's no exact pricing if something is achually a better choice it will drop in price, that's why AMD cards actually can be a rational choice there kek, because tehir price falls long enough until they become the best choice

Message: >>92472703>but this 1tb HDD I have currently still hasn't been filled after 6+ years of useOnce you get into data hoarding, you can easily fill 1 TB in 2 weeks if you find something particularly valuable. Although at that point you are probably better off building a small NAS instead of filling your PC with as many HDD's as possible.
