Subject: RAM moore's law
Post ID: 92462382
Message: Back in my days when I would look at laptops from one year to the next you'd see some spec improvement,now my 5 years old laptop has 32GB of ram and 1TB disk, and i was looking to upgrade but the current top gamma still has those same fucking specs. I would expect to see many laptops with at least 64GB ram and >2TB SSD but they are nowhere to be seen?.Is it because normies don't need more than 32gb ram so producers just don't go there? Or has innovation truly stopped? What the fuck is going on?

Message: You don't really need more than 16GB of RAM and that's being generous. 8GB of RAM is really more than enough for any daily-task programs. What do you need more than 4GB of RAM for anyway?

Message: >>92462382 (OP)128,256, and 512GB DIMMs exist. We have more complex DIMMs with more chips, and there are more bits per chip on modern high end DRAM. End users don't typically have a use case for these, and DRAM sellers want to leave the door open for an upsell. Its not hard to understand this.

Message: >>92462382 (OP)You're full of shit OP.32gig was top of the line 5 years ago and if you get a top of the line laptop today you can get one with 64gig.You have to pay more than you did back then but that's inflation for you.
