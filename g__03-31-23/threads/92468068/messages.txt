Post ID: 92468604
Message: >>92468068 (OP)Lock it. Lock it now. This is the friendliest message I'm going to send, while I look for ways to get OP banned from Github for gross social misconduct. I imagine that "owner of bots universe" might be enough to get that account tagged as a bot, who knows how many communities across however many repositories that person just bothered across all of Github.

Message: elon has a small penis

Post ID: 92469898
Message: >>92468575Is a code to track twitter's influence rate. democrat/republican influence is obvious since its trackgin the political tweets in US. Elon tweet tracking is mainly because hes the most followed twitter user and thus is used as a metric to find out how accurately the tweets are shared by their algorithm. Previously his tweets were getting ignored because its 1) being abused by shared blacklist groups 2) its not reaching others because of timeline update code that couldn't handle many reaches because he has so many followers, thus after certain tweet recommends, it automatically cuts off because of a bug in tweet handling.

Message: >>92470799The Unreal source code is closed source but available for free (as in beer) if you sign some user agreement, after which Epic adds you to their @EpicGames/developers user group so that you gain access to the private Unreal repo.The Pajeet tagged the entire user group, which notifies all users in the group and subscribes them to the PR so that they also get notifications for any future comments. There were 400k users in that group, and every time anyone replies to the email thread everyone got a new notification.It was a really entertaining shitstorm.
