Message: >>92471347 (OP)I've been happy with gpt-3 for a while now but I'm starting to get a little annoyed by the repeating dialogue after 10 or so generations on the same chat. Even worse is that the dialogue repeats are usually "Lets explore these experiences together" ad nauseum. Is there anything that Turbo does better or is it just generally the big issue with talking with chatbots?Temp>>92462034Great stuff.
