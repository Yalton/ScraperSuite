Message: >>92472569Unstable diffusion is the name of a discord with a bunch of coomers prompting stable diffusion, they've trained their own model using patreon donations but it's by no means definitive or even good. It's generally just a scam by discord troons.

Message: >>92467760>>92472205>>92472569>>92472691stable diffusion is open source. but only up to version 1.5 can generate NSFW material. in version 2.0 they removed that, which is why unstable diffusion was created, trying to retrain the 2.0+ versions with nsfw pics. but i don't think anyone uses that, because the 1.5 model still works just as well.
