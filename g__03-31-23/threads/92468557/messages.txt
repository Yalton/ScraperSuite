Message: >>92472669My reasoning should be implicit. It is soulless to live in a world where you can just buy somebody's grandma's corpse. We already have enough problems with people treating others like walking resources to be exploited without reinforcing that image via the literal sale of human remains. Do you really want to live in a world where beautiful cemeteries are replaced with meat markets where socially deranged losers can buy a child's body to do who knows what because it's "just an object"? It would be a descent into even further insanity.

Message: >>92472716well "soulless" is not an argument buddy.the corpses aren't being harmed, because they're not conscious, they're objects, simple as.and families don't own a corpse automatically any more than they own piece of land.if disgust was your argument then by that logic gay people shouldn't kiss in public either since they might make heterosexual people feel repulsed.feeling disgust with no relative obvious harm is not a reason to make said disgusting act illegal.following your logic, people eating ice cream in public should be made illegal because it makes me feel disgusted.what you're proposing is even more insane than a necrophiliac culture and can only stem from schizophrenic delusion.in short this is a you problem. go see a psychiatrist and maybe you'll stop talking to your dead mother.

Message: >>92472910"soulless" is the perfect argument for those who have souls, metaphorical or otherwise. history agrees with me and thankfully so do most people. their authority is perfectly suitable against the tide of modern consumption-obsessed autism. and it's pretty soulless to say>heh, who cares about billions of peoples' opinions from the past to present day, you're just delusional and need to defer to the heckin head doctors because all of those people are wrong and le "science" of psychiatry is correctfull bugman pod dweller mode, and an argument used by WEF tier slavers>>92472501
