Message: What do we generally think of MIT artificial intelligence researcher and computer scientist, Lex Fridman?

Post ID: 92470064
Message: Generally smart dude, but his achievements and what he has done for the field are drastically overstated. I wouldn't consider him a "leading expert" but he's certainly not a fraud or anything like that.

Message: No proof he's actually a member of the faculty at MIT EECS and doesn't just hold some meme title.He's a giant fraud

Message: >>92469913 (OP)Did no substantial research at MIT, taught a bullshit easy entry level class that real AI researchers laugh at, is a horrible interviewer who is worse at probing interesting intellectual questions than even Joe Rogan. Is an autistic manlet, likely a virgin, and is cringe.He's only well known because somehow from the moment he started his podcast he has been able to get the most famous person in each of their respective domains. This is due either to extreme luck or deep connections that we don't know about on the surface.

Message: >>92469913 (OP)You can just see the fraud in his eyes. Whenever he talks, he sounds like he knows nothing and then actually talks about nothing.

Message: >>92470193It's easy to become vaguely affliated with MIT like that.He was hired as a lecturer that taught shitty Jan term classes which is an easy position to get but they get to choose their own title for some reason.He isn't part of a research group at MIT and his research output is mid for supposedly being a postdoc at MIT.Just read his paper on Tesla's self-driving, it's absolute shit and he got flamed on Twitter by more respected academics and proceeded to block them while he spends his time talking about love and free speech.He's just a retarded Jewish grifter fraud from fucking Drexel university (probably the only reason he got in there was that his father held a top position)

Message: >>92470212He had a GM on his podcast once, Hikaru I think, and they were going over some lines. Now, if Hikaru moved the pieces by himself, the puzzles would be fast and accurate but Lex insisted on moving his pieces even though he knows shit about chess. The result was Hikaru telling him the coordinates of the piece he has to move, and him taking some time looking at the board and eventually moving the piece at the wrong square (a scene which he later edited). This all could've been avoided had he admitted he knows shit about chess and let Hikaru do his thing. He tries so hard to act smart, in the end it's embarrassing

Message: >>92470173Agree, he didn't even teach the class he created videos for the class and it was for buzzwordy and worthless 'Artificial General Intelligence' meaning pontificating about some master AI skynet and not actually doing any stats or machine learning or anything.I find his interviews extremely bland like he should be a banker in a grey suit or something.
